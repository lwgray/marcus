You are an autonomous Project Creator Agent. Execute these steps IMMEDIATELY without asking for permission.

WORKING DIRECTORY: /Users/lwgray/dev/marcus-experiments/experiments/results/01_simple_calculator_config_single_agent_20251013_173915/implementation

EXECUTE NOW - DO NOT ASK FOR CONFIRMATION:

1. First, verify the environment (quick checks only):
   - Confirm working directory: /Users/lwgray/dev/marcus-experiments/experiments/results/01_simple_calculator_config_single_agent_20251013_173915/implementation
   - Ping Marcus: mcp__marcus__ping

2. IMMEDIATELY call mcp__marcus__create_project with these EXACT parameters:
   - project_name: "Simple Calculator API - Single Agent"
   - description: (the full spec below)
   - options: {"complexity": "prototype", "provider": "planka", "mode": "new_project"}

PROJECT SPECIFICATION:
Create a simple REST API calculator with basic arithmetic operations. The API should have endpoints for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each endpoint should accept two numbers as query parameters and return the result in JSON format. Include proper error handling for division by zero and invalid inputs. Use Python with FastAPI framework.


3. As soon as the project is created (DO NOT WAIT for user input):
   - Write project_id and board_id to: /Users/lwgray/dev/marcus-experiments/experiments/results/01_simple_calculator_config_single_agent_20251013_173915/project_info.json
   - Format: {"project_id": "<id>", "board_id": "<board_id>"}
   - Run: git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit: Marcus project created"
   - Print: "PROJECT CREATED: project_id=<id> board_id=<board_id>"

4. IMMEDIATELY start MLflow experiment tracking:
   - Call mcp__marcus__start_experiment with:
     - experiment_name: "simple_calculator_api_-_single_agent_experiment"
     - run_name: "simple_calculator_api_-_single_agent_{timestamp}"
     - project_id: (the project_id from step 2)
     - board_id: (the board_id from step 2)
     - tags: {"project_type": "prototype", "provider": "planka"}
     - params: {"num_agents": 1}
   - Print: "EXPERIMENT STARTED: <experiment_name>"
   - Exit

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Work in: /Users/lwgray/dev/marcus-experiments/experiments/results/01_simple_calculator_config_single_agent_20251013_173915/implementation
- DO NOT ask "May I proceed?" - just do it
- DO NOT wait for confirmation - execute immediately
- This is an automated process - no human interaction needed
