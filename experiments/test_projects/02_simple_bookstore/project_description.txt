Build a REST API for a bookstore inventory system. The API should support CRUD operations for books (create, read, update, delete). Each book should have an id, title, author, isbn, price, and quantity in stock. Use in-memory storage (Python dictionary) for simplicity. Include input validation using Pydantic. The API should return proper HTTP status codes and include OpenAPI documentation. Use Python with FastAPI.
