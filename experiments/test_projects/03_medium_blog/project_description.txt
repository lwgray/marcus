Create a blog API with user authentication and post management. Users should be able to register and login using JWT tokens. Authenticated users can create, edit, and delete their own blog posts. Posts should have title, content, author, and timestamp. Include a public endpoint to view all posts. Use PostgreSQL database with SQLAlchemy ORM. Implement proper authentication middleware and password hashing with bcrypt. Include comprehensive tests with 80% coverage. Use Python with FastAPI.
