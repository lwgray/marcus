Build an e-commerce API with products, shopping cart, and order management. Users can register/login, browse products by category, add products to cart, and place orders. Include inventory tracking that decrements when orders are placed. Products have name, description, price, category, and stock quantity. Orders should track items, quantities, total price, and order status (pending/completed/cancelled). Use PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy. Implement JWT authentication, payment calculation logic, and inventory validation. Include database migrations with Alembic. Write comprehensive tests achieving 80% coverage. Use Python with FastAPI.
