Build a comprehensive project management system API with teams, projects, tasks, and collaboration features. Organizations can have multiple teams, each team has members with different roles (admin, manager, member). Teams own projects, projects contain tasks with dependencies, assignments, priorities, and status tracking. Tasks support comments, attachments, time tracking, and activity logs. Implement real-time collaboration with WebSocket for live task updates. Include a notification system for task assignments, mentions, due dates, and status changes. Add dashboard analytics showing project progress, team velocity, burndown charts. Support file uploads for task attachments using S3-compatible storage. Implement advanced search and filtering across projects and tasks. Include calendar view showing task due dates. Support task templates for recurring work. Implement audit logs for all changes. Use PostgreSQL with complex relationships and proper indexing. Add Redis for caching and session management. Include comprehensive permission system (RBAC). Write extensive tests covering all features with 80% coverage. Use Python with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis, WebSockets, and background task processing with Celery.
