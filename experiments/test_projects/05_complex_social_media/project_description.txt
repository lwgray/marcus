Create a social media platform API similar to Twitter with advanced features. Users can register, login, create posts, like posts, comment on posts, follow other users, and receive notifications. Implement a feed system that shows posts from followed users in reverse chronological order. Include real-time features using WebSockets for notifications and live feed updates. Support media uploads for post images. Add search functionality for users and posts. Implement Redis caching for feeds and user sessions. Include rate limiting on API endpoints. Posts support hashtags and mentions. Users have profiles with bio, avatar, follower/following counts. Notifications for likes, comments, follows, and mentions. Use PostgreSQL with proper indexing for performance. Implement comprehensive testing with 80% coverage including WebSocket tests. Use Python with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis, and WebSocket support.
