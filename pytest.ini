# Markers
markers =
    # Speed markers
    unit: Unit tests that run in isolation (<100ms, all mocked)
    fast: Fast integration tests (<5s, mocked external services)
    slow: Slow tests (>30s, real external services or complex workflows)

    # Type markers
    integration: Integration tests (any speed)
    e2e: End-to-end tests that test complete workflows
    performance: Performance and benchmark tests

    # Integration type markers
    internal: Internal integration tests (mocked external services)
    external: External integration tests (real external services)

    # Service requirement markers
    kanban: Tests that require real Kanban board (Planka, GitHub)
    github: Tests that require real GitHub API
    ai: Tests that require real AI provider (expensive, use sparingly)
    database: Tests that require real database

    # Async markers
    asyncio: mark test as async
    anyio: Tests using anyio for async operations

    # Special markers
    visualization: Visualization tests that must be run separately
    flaky: Tests that may fail intermittently and should be retried
    baseline: Tests that establish performance baselines
    no_mock: Tests that use real implementations only

# Coverage options (if using pytest-cov)
