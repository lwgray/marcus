# Single-Agent Experiment Configuration
# For controlled experiments comparing single-agent vs multi-agent performance

# Experiment type (required for detection)
experiment_type: "single_agent"

# Project name (used in experiment tracking)
project_name: "Your Project Name"

# Project description/specification file (relative to experiment dir)
# For structured mode: Should contain Marcus-generated task breakdown
# For unstructured mode: Should contain raw project description

# Single-agent settings
single_agent:
  # Claude model to use
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"

  # Experiment mode:
  # - "structured": Use task breakdown with checkpoints (mimics Marcus structure)
  # - "unstructured": Raw project description only, no scaffolding (pure baseline)
  mode: "structured"

# MLflow experiment tracking (optional but recommended)

# Optional: Marcus baseline for comparison
# Remove this section if you don't have a baseline
