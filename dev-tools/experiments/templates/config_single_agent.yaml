# Single-Agent Experiment Configuration
# For controlled experiments comparing single-agent vs multi-agent performance

# Experiment type (required for detection)
experiment_type: "single_agent"

# Project name (used in experiment tracking)
project_name: "Your Project Name"

# Project description/specification file (relative to experiment dir)
# This should contain the high-level project overview
project_spec_file: "project_spec.md"

# Task breakdown configuration
task_generation:
  # How to generate task structure:
  # - "predefined": Use a predefined task breakdown file
  # - "template": Use a standard template for project type
  # - "ai_generated": Use AI to generate tasks from project spec
  mode: "predefined"

  # Source file for task breakdown (required if mode is "predefined")
  # This should contain the detailed task structure in YAML format
  source: "task_breakdown.yaml"

  # Project type template (optional, used if mode is "template")
  # Options: "rest_api", "web_app", "cli_tool", "data_pipeline"
  template: "rest_api"

# Single-agent settings
single_agent:
  # Claude model to use
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"

  # Experiment mode:
  # - "structured": Use task breakdown with checkpoints (mimics Marcus structure)
  # - "unstructured": Raw project description only, no scaffolding (pure baseline)
  mode: "structured"

  # Enforce checkpoint reporting after each subtask (only for structured mode)
  checkpoint_mode: true

  # Track timing for each subtask
  time_tracking: true

  # Working directory (relative to experiment dir)
  working_directory: "./implementation"

# MLflow experiment tracking (optional but recommended)

  enabled: true
  experiment_name: "{project_name}_single_agent"
  tags:
    agent_type: "single"
    complexity: "standard"

# Optional: Marcus baseline for comparison
# Remove this section if you don't have a baseline
marcus_baseline:
  enabled: false
  time_minutes: null  # e.g., 21.37
  tasks_completed: null  # e.g., 17
