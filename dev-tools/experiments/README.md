## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create a New Multi-Agent Experiment

```bash
cd /Users/lwgray/dev/marcus/dev-tools/experiments
python runners/run_experiment.py --init ~/my-experiments/podcast-generator
```

This creates:
```
~/my-experiments/podcast-generator/
├── config.yaml          # Agent configuration
├── project_spec.md      # What to build
├── prompts/             # Auto-generated prompts
├── logs/                # Agent logs
└── implementation/      # Code output (git repo)
```

### 2. Configure Your Experiment

Edit `config.yaml`:
```yaml
project_name: "Podcast Generator"
project_spec_file: "project_spec.md"

project_options:
  complexity: "standard"
  provider: "sqlite"        # or "planka", "github", "linear"

agents:
  - id: "agent_backend"
    name: "Backend Developer"
    role: "backend"
    skills: ["python", "fastapi", "postgresql"]
    subagents: 5
```

Edit `project_spec.md` with your project description.

### 3. Test Optimal Agent Count (Recommended)

```bash
python testing/test_optimal_agents.py ~/my-experiments/podcast-generator
```

Analyzes your project and recommends the optimal number of agents based on task dependencies.

### 4. Run the Experiment

```bash
python runners/run_experiment.py ~/my-experiments/podcast-generator
```

## 📚 Detailed Component Documentation

### 🏃 Runners (`runners/`)

Main experiment execution scripts.

#### `run_experiment.py`
**Purpose**: Multi-agent Marcus experiment launcher
**Usage**:
```bash
# Initialize new experiment
python runners/run_experiment.py --init <experiment_dir>

# Validate configuration
python runners/run_experiment.py --validate <experiment_dir>

# Run experiment
python runners/run_experiment.py <experiment_dir>
```

**What it does**:
- Creates experiment directory structure
- Spawns project creator agent
- Launches multiple worker agents (configurable)
- Each agent registers with Marcus and requests tasks
- All agents work on `main` branch in implementation/
- Full MLflow tracking integration

**Key Features**:
- Portable (works outside Marcus repo)
- Configurable agent roles and skills
- Subagent support for parallel execution
- Tmux session management
- Automatic prompt generation

---

#### `run_single_agent_experiment.py`
**Purpose**: Single-agent controlled experiment for comparison testing
**Usage**:
```bash
# Initialize single-agent experiment
python runners/run_single_agent_experiment.py --init <experiment_dir>

# Run experiment
python runners/run_single_agent_experiment.py <experiment_dir>

# Log results to MLflow after completion
python runners/run_single_agent_experiment.py --log-results <log_file> <experiment_dir>
```

**What it does**:
- Runs same project spec with a single Claude Code instance
- Two modes:
  - **Structured**: Uses Marcus task breakdown with checkpoints
  - **Unstructured**: Raw project description (pure baseline)
- Time tracking with checkpoint markers
- MLflow integration for comparison

**Configuration** (`config_single_agent.yaml`):
```yaml
experiment_type: "single_agent"
project_name: "Your Project"
project_spec_file: "project_spec.md"

single_agent:
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
  mode: "structured"        # or "unstructured"
  checkpoint_mode: true
  time_tracking: true
```

---

#### `run_comparison_experiment.py`
**Purpose**: Automated batch runner for comparing single vs multi-agent
**Usage**:
```bash

# Run all test projects sequentially
python runners/run_comparison_experiment.py

# Run specific projects
python runners/run_comparison_experiment.py --projects 01_simple_calculator 04_ecommerce

# PARALLEL MODE: Run experiments in parallel (requires multiple Marcus instances)
python runners/run_comparison_experiment.py --parallel --max-parallel 3

# Parallel with custom instance configuration
python runners/run_comparison_experiment.py --parallel --marcus-instances instances.json
```

**What it does**:
- Automatically runs multiple experiment configurations
- Compares single-agent vs multi-agent performance
- Sequential or parallel execution modes
- Generates comparison reports and visualizations
- Full MLflow tracking

**Parallel Mode Requirements**:
- Multiple Marcus instances on different ports
- Each connected to separate Planka boards
- Configuration file: `marcus_instances.example.json`

**Example instances config**:
```json
[
  {"url": "http://localhost:4298", "board_id": "board_0"},
  {"url": "http://localhost:4299", "board_id": "board_1"},
  {"url": "http://localhost:4300", "board_id": "board_2"}
]
```

---

#### `spawn_agents.py`

### 🎯 Scoring (`scoring/`)

Automated project evaluation tools.

#### `score_project.py`
**Purpose**: Rule-based automated project scoring
**Usage**:
```bash
python scoring/score_project.py \
  --project-dir ~/experiments/test1/implementation \
  --output-file score.json
```

**What it does**:
- Evaluates projects across 6 categories (100 points total):
  - **Functionality** (25 pts): Does it run? Do tests pass?
  - **Code Quality** (20 pts): Static analysis, complexity, documentation
  - **Completeness** (20 pts): All deliverables, no stubs
  - **Project Structure** (15 pts): Organization, file count
  - **Documentation** (12 pts): README, API docs, setup instructions
  - **Usability** (8 pts): Single-command startup, examples

**Output** (JSON):
```json
{
  "project_name": "datetime-api",
  "total_score": 82.5,
  "total_possible": 100,
  "percentage": 82.5,
  "categories": [...]
}
```

---

#### `llm_score_project.py`
**Purpose**: LLM-based intelligent project scoring
**Usage**:
```bash
python scoring/llm_score_project.py \

- More accurate for complex projects

**Output** (JSON):
```json
{
  "project_name": "datetime-api",
  "total_score": 85.0,
  "categories": [
    {
      "category": "Functionality",
      "points_earned": 22.0,
      "reasoning": "...",
      "strengths": ["..."],

### 🧪 Testing (`testing/`)

Tools for testing and validating Marcus functionality.

#### `test_optimal_agents.py`
**Purpose**: Calculate optimal agent count BEFORE running experiments
**Usage**:
```bash
python testing/test_optimal_agents.py ~/my-experiments/podcast-generator
```

**What it does**:
1. Reads experiment configuration
2. Creates project in Marcus/Planka
3. Calls `get_optimal_agent_count` MCP tool
4. Analyzes task dependency graph
5. Calculates maximum parallelism
6. Shows optimal agent configuration
7. Offers to update `config.yaml`

**Output**:
```
📊 Project Analysis:
   Total tasks: 87
   Critical path: 12.50 hours
   Max parallelism: 12 tasks can run simultaneously
   Efficiency gain: 85.2% vs single agent

✅ RECOMMENDED: 12 agents

⚙️  Current config.yaml: 18 total agents
   - Backend Dev: 5 subagents + 1 main = 6 total
   - Frontend Dev: 3 subagents + 1 main = 4 total
   ...

⚠️  WARNING: You have 6 more agents than needed
   Extra agents will be idle, wasting resources
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents spawning too many agents (wasted resources)
- Prevents spawning too few agents (missed parallelism)
- Avoids agents dying while waiting for dependencies
- Optimizes cost and performance

---

#### `create_and_analyze_project.py`
**Purpose**: Direct API approach for project creation & analysis
**Usage**:
```bash
python testing/create_and_analyze_project.py ~/my-experiments/test1
```

**What it does**:
- Bypasses Claude Code CLI
- Directly uses Marcus HTTP API (Inspector client)
- Creates project and gets optimal agent count
- Faster for testing/debugging
- Same output as `test_optimal_agents.py`

**Use when**:
- Testing Marcus API directly
- Debugging project creation
- Automating batch project analysis
- Claude Code CLI issues

---

#### `analyze_100_tasks.py`
**Purpose**: Test scheduler with 100 independent tasks
**Usage**:
```bash
python testing/analyze_100_tasks.py
```

**What it does**:
- Loads `100_independent_tasks.json`
- Runs `calculate_optimal_agents` scheduler
- Verifies sweep-line algorithm correctness
- Ensures truly independent tasks all run in parallel

**Expected Result**:
```
✅ SWEEP-LINE ALGORITHM WORKS CORRECTLY!
   All 100 tasks detected as running in parallel.
   This proves the bug fix handles truly independent tasks.
```

**Use for**:
- Validating scheduler fixes
- Testing edge cases
- Performance benchmarking

---

#### `100_independent_tasks.json`
**Purpose**: Test data for `analyze_100_tasks.py`
**Format**: JSON array of Task objects with no dependencies

---

### 🛠️ Utils (`utils/`)

Utility scripts for experiment management.

#### `clean_experiment.sh`
**Purpose**: Clean experiment directory for re-runs
**Usage**:
```bash
./utils/clean_experiment.sh ~/my-experiments/podcast-generator
```

**What it does**:
- Deletes all contents of `prompts/`
- Deletes `project_info.json`
- Deletes all contents of `implementation/` (including `.git`)
- Prompts for confirmation before deletion

**Use before**:
- Re-running an experiment

---

## 📊 MLflow Integration

All experiments are automatically tracked in MLflow.

### View Experiment Results

```bash
# Start MLflow UI
cd dev-tools/experiments
mlflow ui

# Open browser to http://localhost:5000
```

### Tracked Metrics

**Multi-Agent Experiments**:
- `num_agents` - Total agent count
- `duration_seconds` - Experiment duration
- `tasks_created` - Total tasks
- `tasks_completed` - Completed tasks
- `blockers_reported` - Blockers encountered
- `artifacts_logged` - Artifacts created
- `decisions_logged` - Decisions made

**Single-Agent Experiments**:
- `total_duration_seconds` - Total time
- `checkpoints_completed` - Checkpoint count
- `subtasks_completed` - Subtasks done
- Individual checkpoint durations

---

## 🎯 Prerequisites

### Required

- **Marcus MCP Server**: Running on `http://localhost:4298`
  ```bash
  cd /Users/lwgray/dev/marcus
  ./marcus start
  ```

- **Claude Code CLI**: Installed and configured
  ```bash
  claude --version
  ```

- **Python 3.11+**: With dependencies
  ```bash
  pip install pyyaml mlflow
  ```

- **Planka Board**: For Marcus task management
  - Configure in Marcus settings
  - Get board ID from Planka UI

### Optional

- **tmux**: For multi-agent sessions (usually pre-installed on macOS)
- **Analysis Tools**: For visualizations
  ```bash
  pip install -r analysis/requirements.txt
  ```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Marcus MCP server not running"

```bash
# Check status
curl http://localhost:4298/mcp

# Start Marcus
cd /Users/lwgray/dev/marcus
./marcus start

# Configure Claude Code
claude mcp add marcus -t http http://localhost:4298/mcp
```

### "No suitable tasks" loops

- Agents waiting for dependencies
- Check other terminal windows - other agents may be working
- Marcus assigns tasks as dependencies complete
- Use `get_task_context` to debug

### Import errors after reorganization

If you see import errors like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'spawn_agents'`:

```bash
# Make sure you're running scripts from the experiments directory
cd /Users/lwgray/dev/marcus/dev-tools/experiments

# Run with correct paths
python runners/run_experiment.py <experiment_dir>
python testing/test_optimal_agents.py <experiment_dir>
python analysis/parse_single_agent_timing.py <log_file>
```

### Merge conflicts on main

- Rare - Marcus coordinates to prevent this
- If it happens: manually resolve and commit
- Agents continue from resolved state
