# Single Agent DateTime API Implementation - Controlled Experiment v2

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS

You MUST complete ALL subtasks listed below in FULL. Do NOT skip any steps, do NOT provide partial implementations, and do NOT move to the next subtask until the current one is 100% complete.

**After EACH subtask**, you MUST:
1. State "SUBTASK X.X COMPLETE" or "TASK X COMPLETE"
2. List exactly what you created/implemented
3. Wait for confirmation before proceeding

**Failure to complete any subtask fully will invalidate this experiment.**

## Project Description

Build a REST API with two endpoints:
1. One endpoint that returns the current date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. Another endpoint that returns the current time in HH:MM:SS format

The API should be simple and lightweight, suitable for a prototype implementation.

## Time Tracking Instructions

Please track and report:
1. **Start time**: Note exact timestamp when you begin subtask 1.1
2. **After each subtask**: Note completion timestamp
3. **End time**: Note exact timestamp when you complete task 7
4. **Total time**: Calculate total elapsed time in minutes

Example format:
```
START: 2025-10-23 10:15:32
SUBTASK 1.1 COMPLETE: 10:18:45 (3:13 elapsed)
SUBTASK 1.2 COMPLETE: 10:22:10 (6:38 elapsed)
...
TASK 7 COMPLETE: 10:47:18
TOTAL: 31 minutes 46 seconds
```

This timing data is critical for the experiment.

---

## Reminder: COMPLETE EVERY TASK

This is a controlled experiment comparing single-agent performance vs Marcus multi-agent system.

**Marcus baseline**: Completed similar project in 21.37 minutes with 17 subtasks (DateTime API Test 2)

You must complete all 18 tasks/subtasks listed above to provide a fair comparison. Do not skip documentation, do not skip tests, and do not provide stub implementations.

**Organize your files and code however you think is best. The deliverables matter, not the exact file structure.**
