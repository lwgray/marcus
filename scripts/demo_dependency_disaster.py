Marcus Enhanced Systems Demo: The Dependency Disaster

This demo shows a specific, relatable scenario that every developer has experienced:
the classic "frontend team waiting for API team" disaster, and how Marcus prevents it.

Perfect for showing to technical teams who have lived through this pain.
