Marcus Enhanced Systems: 5-Minute Value Demo

This demo quickly shows the core value of Marcus Enhanced Systems
through a simple before/after comparison.

BEFORE: Traditional project management with manual coordination
AFTER: Marcus Enhanced Systems with intelligent automation

Run this to see the difference in under 5 minutes.
