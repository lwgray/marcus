"""
One-shot backfill of ``runs.ended_at`` from ``token_events.timestamp``.

The ``runs`` table has lifecycle columns (``ended_at``, ``total_tasks``,
``completed_tasks``, etc.) that the schema clearly anticipates, but
until Marcus #537 no Python code ever wrote them. Every row in ``runs``
has been "open" since insertion. This blocks any dashboard query
filtering on ``ended_at IS NOT NULL`` and prevents wall-clock-time
analysis (cost-per-minute, coordination tax rate, run duration).

Going forward, ``end_experiment`` closes runs live for the
``path=marcus`` and ``path=posidonius`` flows. This backfill closes
the rest: historical runs that pre-date the fix, and runs from
``path=direct`` usage where the user never invokes ``end_experiment``.

Heuristic
---------
For each ``runs`` row where ``ended_at IS NULL``, set ``ended_at`` to
``MAX(timestamp) FROM token_events WHERE run_id = ?`` — the timestamp
of the last LLM call attributed to that run. That's the best on-disk
approximation we have for unattended close. Runs with zero token
events are left open (genuinely empty runs are ambiguous and likely
indicate the run died before any LLM call).

Idempotent: re-runnable. Rows with ``ended_at`` already set are
skipped (the CostStore's UPDATE only fills NULL fields).

Usage
-----
.. code-block:: console

    $ python scripts/backfill_run_close_state.py
    Closed 23 runs (10 had zero events and were skipped).

Pass ``--costs-db PATH`` to override the cost-store path (defaults
to ``~/.marcus/costs.db``).
