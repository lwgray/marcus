"""Project monitoring and health tracking system.

This module implements comprehensive project monitoring capabilities including
real-time health tracking, risk assessment, performance metrics collection,
and automated alerting for the Marcus system.

Classes
-------
ProjectMonitor
    Core monitoring system that provides continuous project health tracking,
    AI-powered risk analysis, and automated issue detection.

Key Features
------------
- Continuous monitoring loop with configurable intervals
- Real-time project state tracking and metrics collection
- AI-powered project health analysis and risk assessment
- Automated detection of stalled tasks, capacity issues, and bottlenecks
- Historical data tracking for trend analysis
- Integration with MCP Kanban system for task data

Examples
--------
Basic monitoring setup:

>>> import asyncio
>>> from src.monitoring.project_monitor import ProjectMonitor
>>>
>>> async def main():
...     monitor = ProjectMonitor()
...
...     # Start continuous monitoring
...     await monitor.start_monitoring()
>>>
>>> asyncio.run(main())

Manual project state check:

>>> monitor = ProjectMonitor()
>>> state = await monitor.get_project_state()
>>> print(f"Progress: {state.progress_percent}%")
>>> print(f"Risk Level: {state.risk_level}")
>>> print(f"Velocity: {state.team_velocity} tasks/week")

Risk and blocker management:

>>> # Get current risks
>>> risks = monitor.get_current_risks()
>>> for risk in risks:
...     print(f"{risk.risk_type}: {risk.description}")
>>>
>>> # Record a blocker
>>> blocker = await monitor.record_blocker(
...     agent_id="agent-123",
...     task_id="task-456",
...     description="Database connection failed"
