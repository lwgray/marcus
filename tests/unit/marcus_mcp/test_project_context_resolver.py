"""
Unit tests for ``_resolve_project_for_cost`` in marcus_mcp.handlers.

The resolver is what makes the cost dashboard's project axis actually
work. Marcus's identity is ``project_id`` (per CLAUDE.md GH-388 and
spawn_agents.py), so every planner LLM call made while servicing an
MCP request needs to land in the right project bucket.
