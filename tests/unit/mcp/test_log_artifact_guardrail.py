"""
Unit tests for the log_artifact git-tracked file guardrail (GH-385 fix #7).

When an agent calls log_artifact with a path that resolves to a git-tracked
source file, the tool must reject the write and return a descriptive error.
dashboard-v82 post-mortem: Agent 1 overwrote theme.css and design-tokens.json
via log_artifact and had to restore from git (commit d44dd5a).

Tests:
- tracked source file (src/) → rejected
- tracked artifact file (docs/, tmp/) → allowed (iterative refresh)
- untracked file → write proceeds normally
- git not available on non-artifact path → write proceeds (fail-open)
