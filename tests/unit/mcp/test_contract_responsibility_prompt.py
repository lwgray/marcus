"""
Unit tests for Task.responsibility surfacing in agent prompts (GH-320 PR 2).

Tests that when a task carries ``Task.responsibility`` (set by
contract-first decomposition), ``build_tiered_instructions`` adds a
high-signal contract ownership layer that names the contract file and
instructs the agent to read it before writing code.

This layer is what makes contract-first decomposition work in practice:
agents can't produce code that adheres to a contract they haven't read.
