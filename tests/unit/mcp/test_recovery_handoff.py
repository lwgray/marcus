"""
Unit tests for recovery handoff in task instructions.

When a task is recovered from a failed/timed-out agent, the next agent
should receive context about the previous work so they can pick up where
the last agent left off rather than starting from scratch.

This tests the "last mile" wiring: RecoveryInfo is created by
AssignmentLeaseManager.recover_expired_lease() and attached to the task
model, but build_tiered_instructions must include it in the instructions
sent to the next agent.
