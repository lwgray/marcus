## Timeline

These systems are planned for future releases:
- **Phase 1** (6 months): Security, Infrastructure basics
- **Phase 2** (12 months): Enterprise features, Advanced analytics
- **Phase 3** (18 months): Plugin architecture, Mobile support
- **Phase 4** (24 months): Advanced ML, Multi-cloud
- **Experimental**: No fixed timeline, research-driven

## Contributing

To propose new future systems or contribute to planned features:
1. Open an issue with the "future-system" label
2. Provide detailed use cases and benefits
3. Consider backward compatibility
4. Include implementation approach suggestions
