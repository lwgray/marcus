USABILITY PRINCIPLES IMPLEMENTED
----------------------------------

1. Clarity Over Brevity
   ✓ Descriptive field names (estimated_duration vs dur)
   ✓ Self-documenting API responses with _links
   ✓ Full words instead of abbreviations
   ✓ Clear enum values (IN_PROGRESS vs IP)

2. Consistency
   ✓ snake_case for all JSON fields
   ✓ RESTful endpoint naming conventions
   ✓ Standardized response structure across all endpoints
   ✓ Consistent error message format
   ✓ Boolean fields prefixed with is_/has_

3. Forgiveness
   ✓ Undo capability recommendations
   ✓ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   ✓ Grace periods for date validation (1 hour for timezones)
   ✓ Auto-trim whitespace from inputs
   ✓ Soft validation warnings (vs hard errors)

4. Feedback
   ✓ Immediate inline validation as user types
   ✓ Character counters with color coding
   ✓ Progress indicators for long operations
   ✓ Success confirmations with next actions
   ✓ Field-level error messages
   ✓ Live regions for screen readers

5. Simplicity
   ✓ Progressive disclosure of advanced options
   ✓ Smart defaults (status=TODO, priority=MEDIUM)
   ✓ Minimal required fields (only title required for tasks)
   ✓ Helpful placeholder text
   ✓ Optional field labeling

ERROR HANDLING IMPROVEMENTS
----------------------------

Bad Example (Technical):
  "NoneType object has no attribute 'id'"
  Status: 500

Good Example (User-Friendly):
  "Task not found. It may have been deleted or you may not have access to it."
  Next Steps:
    - Check that the task ID is correct
    - The task may have been deleted by you or another user
    - Try refreshing your list to see the latest data
  Status: 404
  Request ID: req_abc123xyz
  Documentation: https://docs.example.com/errors/not-found

Validation Error Format:
{
  "error": "ValidationError",
  "message": "Please fix the following errors:",
  "details": {
    "title": [
      "Title is required and cannot be empty",
      "Title must be at least 3 characters long"
    ],
    "due_date": [
      "The due date must be in the future"
    ]
  },
  "request_id": "req_xyz789",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T14:30:00Z",
  "documentation_url": "https://docs.example.com/errors/validation"
}

API RESPONSE IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------------

List Response with Pagination:
{
  "items": [...],
  "total": 45,
  "page": 1,
  "limit": 20,
  "total_pages": 3,
  "_links": {
    "self": "/api/v1/tasks?page=1&limit=20",
    "next": "/api/v1/tasks?page=2&limit=20",
    "prev": null,
    "first": "/api/v1/tasks?page=1&limit=20",
    "last": "/api/v1/tasks?page=3&limit=20"
  }
}

Benefits:
- Clear pagination info (no guessing)
- Navigation links (HATEOAS principle)
- Total count helps UI show "Showing 1-20 of 45"
- Consistent across ALL list endpoints

Single Resource with Related Links:
{
  "data": {task data},
  "_links": {
    "self": "/api/v1/tasks/abc123",
    "related": {
      "subtasks": "/api/v1/tasks/abc123/subtasks",
      "time_entries": "/api/v1/time/entries?task_id=abc123",
      "project": "/api/v1/projects/xyz789"
    }
  }
}

Benefits:
- Discoverable related resources
- No need to construct URLs manually
- Self-documenting API structure

VALIDATION IMPROVEMENTS
------------------------

Example: Task Title Validation

Technical Approach (Bad):
  - Error: "value_error.min_length"
  - No context or guidance

User-Friendly Approach (Good):
  - Error: "Title must be at least 3 characters long. Please provide a more descriptive task name."
  - Clear requirement (3 characters)
  - Explains why (descriptive name)
  - Actionable (tells user what to do)

Example: Date Validation

With Context:
  if due_date < now():
      raise ValueError(
          "The due date must be in the future. "
          "Please select a date after today."
      )

With Grace Period (for timezones):
  if due_date < now() - timedelta(hours=1):
      raise ValueError(
          "The due date appears to be in the past. "
          "Please select a date and time in the future. "
          "If you're in a different timezone, make sure to use "
          "your local timezone setting."
      )

PASSWORD VALIDATION EXAMPLES
-----------------------------

Technical:
  - "Password must match regex"

User-Friendly:
  - "For better security, include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number in your password."

Benefits:
  - Explains security rationale
  - Lists specific requirements
  - Encourages good behavior without forcing

ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES
-----------------------

✓ Semantic HTML (main, nav, article, aside)
✓ Proper heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3)
✓ ARIA labels for all interactive elements
✓ ARIA live regions for dynamic content
