ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS
-----------------------

Technology Stack:
- Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) with microservices architecture
- Database: PostgreSQL 15 with Redis 7 caching
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ for event-driven processing
- Background Jobs: Celery for async calendar sync
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes with Docker containers
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK Stack

Core Features Designed:
✓ Task Management (CRUD, subtasks, projects, tags, priorities)
✓ Calendar Integration (Google/Microsoft/iCal with bidirectional sync)
✓ Time Tracking (start/stop timer, manual entries, duration aggregation)
✓ Analytics (productivity dashboard, time distribution, trends)
✓ Authentication (JWT + OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens)
✓ Notifications (email, push, in-app)

Performance Targets:
- API Response: < 100ms (target), < 500ms (max)
- System Uptime: 99.9%
- Concurrent Users: 10,000+
- Calendar Sync Accuracy: 95%+
- Test Coverage: 80%+

Security Features:
- JWT authentication with 1-hour access tokens
- OAuth 2.0 for calendar provider integrations
- Password hashing with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- Token encryption for calendar credentials (AES-256)
- Row-level security in database
- Rate limiting (100 req/min per user)
- TLS 1.3 for all communications

IMPLEMENTATION READINESS
-------------------------

Dependencies for Implementation Tasks:
✓ Data models defined for Task Creation and Organization
✓ API endpoints specified for Time Tracking
✓ Calendar sync architecture designed for Calendar Integration
✓ Database schema ready for all implementations
✓ Performance requirements specified for testing
✓ Security architecture defined for all services

All 8 dependent tasks can now proceed with implementation:
1. Implement Task Creation and Organization
2. Test Task Creation and Organization
3. Implement Time Tracking
4. Test Time Tracking
5. Implement Calendar Integration
6. Test Calendar Integration
7. Implement Performance Requirements
8. Implement Usability Requirements

ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS LOGGED
-------------------------------

Key Design Decisions:
1. Microservices over monolith for scalability and team autonomy
2. PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex queries
3. JWT for stateless authentication
4. Event-driven architecture for analytics and notifications
5. Bidirectional sync with last-write-wins conflict resolution
6. Redis for caching and job queues
7. Kubernetes for production orchestration
8. OpenAPI-first design for API contracts

SUCCESS CRITERIA
----------------

Primary Goal: 20% increase in user productivity within 6 months
- Baseline: 10 tasks/week per user
- Target: 12 tasks/week after 6 months

Technical Metrics:
✓ 95%+ calendar sync accuracy
✓ Sub-second API response times
✓ 99.9% system uptime
✓ 80%+ test coverage
✓ Zero critical security vulnerabilities
