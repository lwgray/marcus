# JWT-Based Authentication Design Document

**Project:** Twitter Clone
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Author:** Worker Agent 07
**Status:** Design Proposal

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive design for implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication for the Twitter Clone application. The proposed solution follows industry best practices, addresses common security concerns, and provides a scalable foundation for user authentication and authorization.

## Key Highlights

- **Dual Token Strategy**: Short-lived access tokens (15 min) + long-lived refresh tokens (7 days) with rotation
- **Security First**: OWASP compliant, httpOnly cookies, CSRF/XSS protection, Redis-based token blacklist
- **Complete API Specs**: 6 REST endpoints with detailed request/response formats
- **Database Models**: PostgreSQL schemas for users and refresh tokens with proper indexing
- **Implementation Ready**: Code examples, environment configs, deployment strategies
- **12-Week Timeline**: Phased implementation plan from foundation to production

## Security Features

1. RS256/HS256 signing algorithms with 256-bit keys
2. httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies
3. Rate limiting on all auth endpoints
4. Refresh token rotation with reuse detection
5. Redis blacklist for immediate token revocation
6. Comprehensive logging and monitoring
7. Protection against XSS, CSRF, replay attacks

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express/Fastify, jsonwebtoken, bcrypt, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Axios with auto-refresh interceptors
- **Security**: Helmet.js, express-rate-limit, zod validation

## Implementation Phases

1. Foundation (Week 1-2): Database schemas, user registration, basic JWT
2. Core Auth (Week 3-4): Login, token validation, refresh mechanism
3. Security (Week 5-6): Rate limiting, CSRF, Redis blacklist, token rotation
4. Frontend (Week 7-8): React auth context, auto-refresh, UI components
5. Testing (Week 9-10): Unit, integration, security, performance tests
6. Deployment (Week 11-12): Staging, production, documentation
