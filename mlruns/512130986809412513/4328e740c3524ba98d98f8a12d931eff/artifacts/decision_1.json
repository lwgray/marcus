  "decision": "Choosing REST API architecture with OpenAPI 3.0 specification for tweet posting system. Design decisions: (1) Character limit: 280 characters for text tweets following Twitter standards. (2) Media handling: Separate media upload endpoint returning media_id for attachment to tweets. (3) Data model: Tweet entity with user_id, text content, media references, timestamps, and engagement counters (likes, retweets). (4) Authentication: JWT Bearer tokens for all authenticated endpoints. (5) Response format: Consistent JSON with {data, meta} structure for pagination support. This affects all API endpoints and data models across the project."
