  "decision": "I chose JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication because it's stateless, scalable, and allows the API to remain RESTful without server-side session storage. Access tokens will expire in 15 minutes, refresh tokens in 7 days. This affects all protected API endpoints which will require Bearer token authentication in the Authorization header."
