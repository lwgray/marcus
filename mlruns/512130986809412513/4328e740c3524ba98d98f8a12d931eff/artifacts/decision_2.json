  "decision": "Designing Following Users API with REST architecture. Choosing to implement bidirectional follow relationships (following/followers) with separate endpoints for follow, unfollow, get followers, and get following. Using paginated responses for scalability. Will implement follower counts and follow status checks. Authentication required via JWT tokens for all endpoints."
