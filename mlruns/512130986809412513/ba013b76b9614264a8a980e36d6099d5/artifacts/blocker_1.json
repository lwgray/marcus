The diagnostics show:\n- 8 TODO tasks are blocked by dependencies\n- \"Design User Authentication\" is blocking 8 tasks\n- \"Design Tweet Management\" is blocking 8 tasks  \n- \"Design Following/Followers\" is blocking 8 tasks\n\nThis appears to be a circular dependency issue where all tasks are waiting for each other. Need guidance on how to break this dependency cycle.",
