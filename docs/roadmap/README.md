## Key Themes

### **From Project Creation to Universal Assistant**

Marcus is evolving from:
- **Current**: Natural language â†’ structured project plans
- **Near Future**: GitHub issues â†’ automated fixes
- **Long Term**: General software engineering intelligence

### **Progressive Capability Addition**

Evolution happens in layers:
1. **Core Coordination** (Done) - Multi-agent task management
2. **Code Understanding** (Phase 2-3) - Vector DB, code analysis
3. **Autonomous Problem Solving** (Phase 3-4) - Issue resolution, PR generation
4. **Proactive Intelligence** (Phase 4+) - Detect problems, suggest improvements

### **Research & Production Balance**

Marcus serves two purposes:
- **Production Tool** - Help teams build software effectively
- **Research Platform** - Study multi-agent coordination patterns

Both purposes drive development priorities.

### **Community-Driven Development**

Marcus evolves through:
- **Open Source Contributions** - Community features and fixes
- **Pattern Sharing** - Collective learning from successful projects
- **Empirical Data** - Every project improves the system
- **User Feedback** - Real-world needs guide priorities
