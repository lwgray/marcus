# Marcus Public Release Roadmap

> **Mission**: Help individual developers manage their projects with AI agents, making solo development as powerful as team development.

## üéØ Release Strategy: Progressive Value Delivery

### **Core Value Proposition**
**"See Everything, Predict Problems, Optimize Work"** - Turn development chaos into smooth, predictable delivery.

**Target Users**:
1. **Solo Developers** - Managing multiple projects alone
2. **Indie Hackers** - Building products without a team
3. **Small Teams** (2-5 people) - Informal collaboration
4. **Open Source Maintainers** - Managing contributions

**Their Pain Points**:
- Overwhelming project complexity
- No team to delegate to
- Losing track of what needs doing
- Working on the wrong things

## üéâ Vision: 6 Months After Launch

**Marcus + Seneca is the go-to solution for teams who want intelligent project management without complexity.**

**Success Looks Like**:
- **5,000+ active installations** across diverse projects
- **"This saves me hours every week"** - consistent user feedback
- **Featured in major developer publications** and conferences
- **Active open-source community** contributing features
- **Commercial opportunities** with enterprise customers
- **SWE-bench results** showing significant productivity gains

**The Ultimate Achievement**: Development teams spend their time building great products instead of managing the chaos of building them. Marcus becomes as essential as Git for modern software development.

**Core Principle**: Simple enough that a stoic could use it, powerful enough that 10x engineers love it.
