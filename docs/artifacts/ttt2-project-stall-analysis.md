# TTT2 Project Stall Analysis and Resolution Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Reported By:** Agent-13
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Active Deadlock

---

## Executive Summary

The ttt2 project is experiencing a complete deadlock with 0 tasks available for assignment. All 11+ agents requesting work are being told "no tasks available" despite having 5 TODO tasks and 33.3% project completion.

**Root Cause:** Three implementation tasks are stuck in "in_progress" state without assigned agents, blocking all downstream work.

---

## Detailed Problem Analysis

### Current State
- **Total Tasks:** 12
- **Completed:** 4 (33.3%)
- **In Progress:** 3 (stuck)
- **TODO:** 5 (blocked)
- **Available for Assignment:** 0

### The Deadlock Triangle

Three tasks are causing the complete project stall:

1. **Implement Display Board** (ID: 1616189375584929519)
   - Status: in_progress
   - Assigned To: **null** ❌
   - Dependencies: All completed ✅
   - Blocking: 5 downstream tasks

2. **Implement Player Moves** (ID: 1616189379527575296)
   - Status: in_progress
   - Assigned To: **null** ❌
   - Dependencies: All completed ✅
   - Blocking: 5 downstream tasks

3. **Implement Usability** (ID: 1616189385810642713)
   - Status: in_progress
   - Assigned To: **null** ❌
   - Dependencies: All completed ✅
   - Blocking: 5 downstream tasks

### Why This Creates a Deadlock

```
Marcus Task Assignment Logic:
1. If task.status == "in_progress" → Don't assign (already being worked)
2. If task.assigned_to == null AND status == "in_progress" → Orphaned task
3. If all available tasks are orphaned → No tasks to assign
4. If blocked tasks depend on orphaned tasks → Complete deadlock
```

### Dependency Visualization

```
COMPLETED (4 tasks) ✅
├─ Design Display Board
├─ Design Player Moves
├─ Design Input Validation
└─ Implement Performance

STUCK IN PROGRESS (3 tasks) ⚠️
├─ Implement Display Board (assigned_to: null)
├─ Implement Player Moves (assigned_to: null)
└─ Implement Usability (assigned_to: null)

BLOCKED TODO (5 tasks) 🔒
├─ Test Display Board (depends on 3 stuck tasks)
├─ Test Player Moves (depends on 3 stuck tasks)
├─ Implement Input Validation (depends on 3 stuck tasks)
├─ Test Input Validation (depends on 3 stuck tasks)
└─ Create PROJECT_SUCCESS docs (depends on ALL 11 other tasks)
```

## Impact Assessment

### Affected Agents
The following agents have requested tasks and received "no tasks available":
- agent-2, agent-4, agent-5, agent-6, agent-7, agent-8, agent-9, agent-10
- agent-11, agent-12, agent-13, agent-14, agent-15, agent-16

**Total:** 14+ agents idle

### Wasted Resources
- Estimated 14 agents × idle time = significant productivity loss
- Project velocity: 0.0 (stalled)
- Risk level: Currently "low" but should be CRITICAL

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### How Did This Happen?

**Hypothesis 1: Premature Status Update**
- Tasks were marked "in_progress" before agent assignment completed
- Agent assignment failed or was cancelled
- Status was never rolled back to "todo"

**Hypothesis 2: Agent Disconnection**
- Tasks were assigned to agents that disconnected/crashed
- Cleanup process didn't reset task status
- Tasks left orphaned in "in_progress" state

**Hypothesis 3: Race Condition**
- Multiple agents requested same task simultaneously
- Status updated to "in_progress" for all
- Only one got proper assignment
- Others left orphaned

**Most Likely:** Combination of 1 and 2 - tasks marked in_progress, agents crashed/disconnected, no cleanup performed.

---

## Resolution Options

### Option 1: Manual Task Reset (RECOMMENDED - FASTEST)
**Action Required:** Reset the 3 orphaned tasks to "todo" status

**Steps:**
1. Access Kanban board directly (Planka UI or API)
2. Locate tasks: 1616189375584929519, 1616189379527575296, 1616189385810642713
3. Change status from "in_progress" → "todo"
4. Verify assigned_to field is cleared
5. Marcus will immediately detect and assign tasks

**Time to Resolution:** 5 minutes
**Risk:** Low
**Impact:** Immediate unlock of all 3 bottleneck tasks

### Option 2: Implement Automatic Orphan Detection
**Action Required:** Add Marcus feature to detect and recover orphaned tasks

**Implementation:**
```python
def detect_orphaned_tasks():
    """Find tasks with status=in_progress but assigned_to=null"""
    orphaned = [
        task for task in all_tasks
        if task.status == "in_progress" and task.assigned_to is None
    ]
    return orphaned

def auto_recover_orphaned_tasks():
    """Reset orphaned tasks to todo status"""
    orphaned = detect_orphaned_tasks()
    for task in orphaned:
        task.status = "todo"
        task.assigned_to = None
        log_recovery(task)
```

**Time to Implementation:** 2-4 hours
**Risk:** Medium (requires testing)
**Impact:** Prevents future deadlocks

### Option 3: Force Reassignment
**Action Required:** Assign the 3 tasks to available agents

**Steps:**
1. Assign "Implement Display Board" → agent-13 (python, devops skills)
2. Assign "Implement Player Moves" → agent-14 (python, testing, api skills)
3. Assign "Implement Usability" → agent-15 (python, database, frontend skills)
4. Agents immediately start work

**Time to Resolution:** 10 minutes
**Risk:** Medium (agents may not be ready)
**Impact:** Unlocks project but requires coordination

## Immediate Recommended Actions

### Phase 1: Emergency Unlock (NOW)
1. ✅ Stall detected and documented
2. ⏳ **URGENT:** Human operator must reset 3 orphaned tasks to "todo"
3. ⏳ Verify tasks become available in next Marcus refresh cycle
4. ⏳ Monitor agent assignment and task pickup

### Phase 2: Prevention (NEXT)
1. Implement orphaned task detection in Marcus
2. Add health check: periodic scan for `status=in_progress AND assigned_to=null`
3. Add automatic recovery: reset orphaned tasks after timeout (e.g., 5 minutes)
4. Add monitoring alert: notify when tasks become orphaned

### Phase 3: Long-term Fix (SOON)
1. Implement transactional task assignment:
   ```python
   with transaction():
       task.status = "in_progress"
       task.assigned_to = agent_id
       agent.current_task = task_id
       # All or nothing - prevents orphans
   ```
2. Add agent heartbeat mechanism
3. Auto-cleanup on agent disconnect
4. Add task assignment timeout with rollback

---

## Prevention Measures

### Monitoring
- Add metric: Count of orphaned tasks
- Add alert: Trigger when orphaned_tasks > 0
- Add dashboard: Show task status distribution in real-time

### Process Improvements
- Task assignment must be atomic operation
- Agent must confirm task receipt before status changes
- Implement task assignment timeout (30 seconds)
- On timeout: rollback status to "todo"

### Testing
- Add integration test: Agent disconnect during assignment
- Add integration test: Multiple agents request same task
- Add performance test: High concurrency task requests
- Add chaos test: Random agent failures during assignment

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Stateful systems need cleanup mechanisms** - Tasks can get stuck in intermediate states
2. **Assignment should be atomic** - Status and agent_id must update together
3. **Health checks are critical** - Need periodic validation of system consistency
4. **Orphaned resources need detection** - Auto-recovery prevents manual intervention

---

## Success Criteria

### Immediate
- [ ] All 3 orphaned tasks reset to "todo"
- [ ] Tasks successfully assigned to agents
- [ ] Agents begin implementation work
- [ ] Project velocity > 0

### Short-term
- [ ] Orphan detection implemented
- [ ] Auto-recovery tested and deployed
- [ ] No new orphaned tasks in next 24 hours

### Long-term
- [ ] Atomic task assignment implemented
- [ ] Agent heartbeat system deployed
- [ ] Zero orphaned tasks for 30 days
- [ ] Complete project without further deadlocks

## Next Steps for Human Operator

**CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. Open Planka board for project "ttt2"
2. Find these 3 cards:
   - "Implement Display Board"
   - "Implement Player Moves"
   - "Implement Usability"
3. Move them from "in_progress" → "To Do" column
4. Verify assigned agent is cleared
5. Return here and confirm: "Tasks reset complete"

**Expected Outcome:** Within 30 seconds, Marcus will detect the available tasks and assign them to waiting agents, unlocking the entire project.
