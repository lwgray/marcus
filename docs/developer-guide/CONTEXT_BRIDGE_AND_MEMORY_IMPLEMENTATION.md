# Context Bridge and Multi-Tier Memory Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of missing features from the Context Bridge and Multi-Tier Memory enhancement proposals for Marcus.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Context Bridge Enhancements

#### Dependency Awareness in Task Assignments
- **Location**: `src/core/context.py` and `src/marcus_mcp/tools/task.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - `analyze_dependencies()` - Builds a dependency map showing which tasks depend on each task
  - `infer_needed_interface()` - Intelligently infers what dependent tasks need from their dependencies
  - Dependency information is now included in task assignments

#### Enhanced Task Instructions
- **Location**: `src/marcus_mcp/tools/task.py` - `build_tiered_instructions()`
- **Tiered System**:
  1. Base instructions (always included)
  2. Implementation context (if previous work exists)
  3. Dependency awareness (if task has dependents)
  4. Decision logging prompts (for high-impact tasks)
  5. Predictions and warnings (risk factors, time estimates)
  6. Task-specific guidance (based on labels)

### 2. Multi-Tier Memory System Enhancements

#### Predictive Intelligence Methods
- **Location**: `src/core/memory.py`
- **New Methods**:

##### `predict_completion_time(agent_id, task)`
- Predicts task duration with confidence intervals
- Considers agent history and task similarity
- Provides influencing factors (time of day, agent accuracy)
- Returns confidence level based on available data

##### `predict_blockage_probability(agent_id, task)`
- Analyzes likelihood of encountering blockers
- Breaks down risks by type (authentication, integration, dependencies)
- Provides preventive measures
- Tracks historical blockers from similar tasks

##### `predict_cascade_effects(task_id, delay_hours)`
- Calculates impact of delays on dependent tasks
- Uses BFS to trace dependency chains
- Estimates cumulative delays with propagation factors
- Suggests mitigation strategies

##### `calculate_agent_performance_trajectory(agent_id)`
- Tracks skill development over time
- Identifies improving and struggling skills
- Projects future performance
- Provides personalized recommendations

#### Integration with Task Assignment
- **Location**: `src/marcus_mcp/tools/task.py`
- All predictive methods are called during task assignment
- Results are incorporated into task instructions
- Agents receive comprehensive insights about:
  - Expected completion time with confidence bounds
  - Specific blockage risks and prevention tips
  - Impact of delays on dependent tasks
  - Performance improvement opportunities

### 3. Adaptive Dependency Inference

#### Learning-Based Dependency System
- **Location**: `src/core/adaptive_dependencies.py`
- **Key Features**:
  - Signal-based inference (temporal, naming, entities, actions, labels)
  - Learning from user feedback
  - Pattern recognition from confirmed dependencies
  - Integration with kanban board as source of truth

## Implementation Details

### Context Flow

1. **Task Request**: Agent requests next task via `request_next_task`
2. **Dependency Analysis**: System analyzes project tasks to find dependents
3. **Interface Inference**: For each dependent, system infers what it needs
4. **Context Building**: Previous implementations + dependency awareness combined
5. **Prediction Generation**: Memory system generates all predictive insights
6. **Instruction Assembly**: Tiered instructions built with all context
7. **Task Assignment**: Agent receives rich context with their task

### Memory System Integration

1. **Project Task Tracking**: `update_project_tasks()` keeps all tasks in working memory
2. **Cascade Analysis**: Uses dependency map to trace impact chains
3. **Historical Learning**: Tracks outcomes to improve predictions
4. **Performance Tracking**: Monitors agent skill development

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Non-Prescriptive Patterns**: Dependency inference uses signals, not hard rules
2. **Confidence-Based**: All predictions include confidence levels
3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation if systems unavailable
4. **Kanban as Truth**: User-defined dependencies from kanban board are authoritative

## Usage Examples

### Agent Receiving Enhanced Context

```json
{
  "task": {
    "id": "task-123",
    "name": "Create user API endpoints",
    "dependency_awareness": "2 future tasks depend on your work:\n- Build user management UI (needs: REST API endpoints with JSON responses)\n- Write integration tests (needs: Documented endpoints with examples)",
    "predictions": {
      "completion_time": {
        "expected_hours": 16.5,
        "confidence_interval": {"lower": 12.4, "upper": 20.6},
        "factors": ["Agent tends to underestimate (85% accuracy)"]
      },
      "blockage_analysis": {
        "overall_risk": 0.65,
        "preventive_measures": [
          "Ensure API credentials and auth documentation are available",
          "Review integration points and API contracts before starting"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Memory System Cascade Analysis

```python
# When a task might be delayed
cascade_effects = await memory.predict_cascade_effects("api-task", 4.0)
# Returns:
{
  "affected_tasks": [
    {"task_id": "ui-task", "delay_hours": 3.2},
    {"task_id": "test-task", "delay_hours": 2.56}
  ],
  "total_delay": 9.76,
  "critical_path_impact": True,
  "mitigation_options": ["Consider parallel execution of independent dependent tasks"]
}
```

## Testing

- Unit tests: `tests/unit/core/test_memory_predictions.py`
- Context tests: `tests/unit/core/test_context_bridge.py`
- Integration tests needed for full workflow validation

## Future Enhancements

1. **ML Model Integration**: Replace heuristics with trained models
2. **Real-time Learning**: Update predictions as tasks complete
3. **Cross-Project Learning**: Share patterns across projects
4. **Advanced Visualizations**: Show dependency graphs in Seneca/Zeno
