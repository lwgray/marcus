# üöÄ START HERE - Marcus Documentation Guide

## What You're Building
Marcus is an AI orchestration system that uses:
- **Kanban boards** (Planka) to manage tasks and projects
- **AI agents** to work on those tasks
- **Seneca dashboard** to visualize progress and analytics

## üìñ Documentation Reading Order

### 1. First Day - Understand the Vision (30 min)
Read these to understand what you're building and why:

1. **Progressive Architecture** (`/docs/progressive-architecture-implementation.md`)
   - Shows how Marcus grows from solo dev ‚Üí team ‚Üí enterprise
   - Key insight: Start simple, but architect for growth

2. **Analytics User Value Mapping** (`/seneca/docs/analytics-user-value-mapping.md`)
   - Shows exactly what value each visualization provides
   - Answers: "Why are we building this chart?"

### 2. Choose Your Path

#### Path A: "I want to build the MVP dashboard" (7 days)
Follow the step-by-step guide in:
- **Dev Guide Implementation Plans** (`dev-guide-implementation-plans.md`)
- Start with "üöÄ Immediate Step-by-Step: MVP in 7 Days"
- This gives you daily tasks for a working MVP

#### Path B: "I want to implement a specific feature"
Use the reusable plans:
- **Dev Guide Implementation Plans** (`dev-guide-implementation-plans.md`)
- Jump to "üì¶ Reusable Implementation Plans"
- Say "implement Plan G" for analytics dashboard
- Say "implement Plan A + G" for solo dev setup + dashboard

#### Path C: "I want to understand scaling"
Read the transition guide:
- **Scaling Transition Guide** (`/docs/scaling-transition-guide.md`)
- Shows how to grow from 1 ‚Üí 10 ‚Üí 100 users
- Includes migration commands and architecture changes

## üéØ Quick Decisions

### "What storage do I need?"
- **Marcus**: Uses kanban boards (already set up)
- **Seneca**: Can use simple in-memory cache to start
- **Later**: Add Redis/PostgreSQL when you have multiple users

### "What should I build first?"
Start with these 5 MVP visualizations:
1. Project Health Gauge - "Is my project okay?"
2. Task Velocity Chart - "Am I getting faster or slower?"
3. Timeline Prediction - "When will I actually finish?"
4. Agent Workload - "Who's doing what?"
5. Smart Task Queue - "What should I work on next?"

### "How do I know if it's working?"
Each visualization should:
- Answer a specific question
- Enable a specific action
- Save measurable time

Example: Health Gauge drops to yellow ‚Üí You investigate ‚Üí You prevent a 3-day delay

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Shortcuts

### Quick MVP Setup (Solo Developer)
```bash
# 1. Clone both repos
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/marcus
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/seneca

# 2. Start Marcus (already connected to kanban)
cd marcus
python -m marcus_mcp.server

# 3. Start Seneca dashboard
cd ../seneca
python app.py

# 4. Open http://localhost:5000
```

### Add Analytics (Plan G)
```python
# In Seneca, create these endpoints:
/api/analytics/health        # Calls 3 Marcus tools, returns 0-100
/api/analytics/velocity      # Gets task completion rates
/api/analytics/timeline      # Predicts completion date
/api/analytics/agents        # Shows agent workloads
/api/analytics/queue         # AI-recommended task order
```

### Test with Demo Data
```bash
# Marcus includes a demo project generator
cd marcus/projects/todo_app
python setup_demo_project.py

# This creates tasks, agents, and activity
# Perfect for testing your dashboard
```

## üìö Document Reference

### Architecture & Planning
- `/marcus/docs/progressive-architecture-implementation.md` - How to build it
- `/marcus/docs/scaling-transition-guide.md` - How to grow it
- `/marcus/dev-guide-implementation-plans.md` - Reusable implementation plans

### Value & Analytics
- `/seneca/docs/analytics-user-value-mapping.md` - Why each feature matters
- `/seneca/docs/analytics-implementation-guide.md` - How to build analytics

### When You're Stuck
1. Check if there's a "Plan X" for what you're trying to do
2. Look at the value mapping to understand the "why"
3. Use the progressive architecture to see if you're over-engineering

## üéÆ Interactive Commands

When working with me (Claude), you can say:
- "Implement Plan A" - Get solo developer setup
- "Implement Plan G" - Build analytics dashboard MVP
- "Show me the 7-day plan" - Get step-by-step MVP guide
- "What's the value of [feature]?" - Understand why to build it

## üö¶ Success Criteria

You'll know you're successful when:
1. **Day 1**: Dashboard shows project health
2. **Day 3**: All 5 MVP charts working with manual refresh
3. **Day 7**: Solo developers can use it immediately
4. **Month 2**: Ready to add team features if needed

## ‚ö° Remember

- **Start simple**: No Redis, no PostgreSQL, just kanban + local cache
- **Manual refresh**: Don't build real-time until you have multiple users
- **Focus on value**: Every chart must save time or prevent problems
- **Progressive enhancement**: Features unlock as infrastructure improves

---

**Next Step**: Choose your path above and start building! The faster you get something working, the sooner you'll get feedback and momentum.
