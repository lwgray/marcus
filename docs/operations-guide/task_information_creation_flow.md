# Task Information Creation Flow

## Overview
This document traces the complete flow of how task information is created in Marcus, from initial project request to final task assignment.

## Task Information Creation Flow

| **Stage** | **Who Creates** | **What Information** | **Code Snippet** | **Where It Goes** |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **1. Project Request** | User | Project description | `"Create a simple CLI todo app with features like adding tasks, listing tasks..."` | Input to create_project |
| **2. PRD Analysis** | AI (Claude) | Structured requirements | ```python<br># advanced_parser.py:_analyze_prd_deeply()<br>prompt = f"""Analyze this project requirements document...<br>Extract:<br>- functional_requirements<br>- non_functional_requirements<br>- business_objectives"""``` | Internal processing |
| **3. Task Name Generation** | AI (Claude) | Task names based on type | ```python<br># advanced_parser.py:_generate_design_task()<br>if domain == "crud_operations":<br>    name = "Design CRUD API Architecture"<br>elif domain == "authentication":<br>    name = "Design Authentication Flow"``` | Task object |
| **4. Task Description** | AI (Claude) | Detailed task description | ```python<br># advanced_parser.py:_generate_design_task()<br>description = f"Create architectural design and documentation for {feature_context}. This includes data models, API endpoints, integration patterns..."``` | Task object â†’ Planka card |
| **5. Acceptance Criteria** | AI (Claude) | 5 specific criteria | ```python<br># advanced_parser.py:_generate_acceptance_criteria()<br>criteria = [<br>    "API endpoints documented with request/response formats",<br>    "Data models defined with all fields and relationships",<br>    "Error handling strategies outlined"<br>]``` | Planka checklist |
| **6. Subtasks** | AI (Claude) | 7 breakdown items | ```python<br># advanced_parser.py:_generate_subtasks()<br>subtasks = [<br>    "Define data model structure",<br>    "Design API endpoint specifications",<br>    "Plan database schema"<br>]``` | Planka checklist |
| **7. Planka Card** | Kanban Client | Physical card creation | ```python<br># kanban_client_with_create.py:create_task()<br>await session.call_tool(<br>    "mcp_kanban_card_manager",<br>    {<br>        "action": "create",<br>        "name": card_name,<br>        "description": card_description<br>    }<br>)``` | Planka board |
| **8. Instructions** | AI (Claude) | Detailed work instructions | ```python<br># ai_analysis_engine.py:generate_task_instructions()<br>prompt = f"""Generate detailed instructions for: {task.name}<br>Task type: {task_type}<br>Include:<br>- Step-by-step guide<br>- Technical specifications<br>- Best practices"""``` | Agent assignment only |
| **9. Enhanced Context** | Marcus | Dependencies, predictions | ```python<br># task.py:build_tiered_instructions()<br>if dependency_awareness:<br>    instructions_parts.append(<br>        f"ðŸ”— DEPENDENCY AWARENESS:\n{dependency_awareness}"<br>    )``` | Agent assignment only |

## Complete Flow Details

### 1. Entry Point: create_project MCP Command
- User calls `create_project` with:
  - `description`: Natural language project description
  - `project_name`: Name for the project
  - `options`: Complexity, deployment, team_size, tech_stack, deadline

### 2. Pipeline Tracking Initialization
- `src/marcus_mcp/tools/nlp.py`: Creates flow_id, initializes pipeline tracking
- `src/integrations/pipeline_tracked_nlp.py`: Wraps NLP tools with pipeline visualization

### 3. PRD Analysis Phase
- `src/ai/advanced/prd/advanced_parser.py`: `_analyze_prd_deeply()`
  - Uses Claude to analyze project description
  - Extracts functional requirements, non-functional requirements, constraints
  - Generates structured analysis with business objectives and technical constraints

### 4. Task Generation Phase
- `src/ai/advanced/prd/advanced_parser.py`: `parse_prd_to_tasks()`
  - **Task Hierarchy Creation**: `_generate_task_hierarchy()`
    - Creates epics from functional requirements
    - Breaks down each epic into tasks (design, implement, test)
    - Filters based on project size/complexity

  - **Detailed Task Creation**: `_create_detailed_tasks()`
    - For each task in hierarchy:
      - Calls `_generate_detailed_task()`
      - Which calls `_enhance_task_with_ai()`
      - Which generates task name and description using methods like:
        - `_generate_design_task()`: Creates design task names/descriptions
        - `_generate_implementation_task()`: Creates implementation task names/descriptions
        - `_generate_testing_task()`: Creates testing task names/descriptions

### 5. Task Name Generation
The task names are generated based on:
- **Task Type** (design/implement/test)
- **Feature Context** from PRD analysis
- **Domain Detection** (CRUD, authentication, frontend, etc.)

### 6. Task Enhancement
Each task gets:
- **Name**: Context-aware, descriptive title
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of what to do
- **Labels**: Component, type, priority, skill, complexity labels
- **Acceptance Criteria**: 5 specific criteria for completion
- **Subtasks**: 7 breakdown items as checklist
- **Estimated Hours**: Based on task type
- **Dependencies**: Inferred by AI

### 7. Safety Checks & Kanban Creation
- `src/integrations/nlp_base.py`: `create_tasks_on_board()`
  - Applies safety checks (deployment depends on testing, etc.)
  - For each task, calls kanban client

### 8. Planka Task Creation
- `src/integrations/kanban_client_with_create.py`: `create_task()`
  - Finds target list (Backlog/TODO)
  - Creates card with name and description
  - Adds labels (creates if needed)
  - Adds checklist items (acceptance criteria + subtasks)
  - Adds metadata comment (priority, estimated hours, dependencies)

### 9. Task Assignment & Instructions
When an agent requests a task:
- `src/marcus_mcp/tools/task.py`: `request_next_task()`
  - Finds optimal task for agent
  - Calls `generate_task_instructions()` on AI engine

- `src/integrations/ai_analysis_engine.py`: `generate_task_instructions()`
  - Uses Claude with task-type specific prompt
  - Generates detailed, contextual instructions for the agent
  - Builds tiered instructions with context, dependencies, predictions

### 10. What Gets Stored in Planka
The final task in Planka contains:
- **Title**: The generated task name (e.g., "Design CRUD API Architecture")
- **Description**: The generated detailed description
- **Labels**: All the generated labels
- **Checklist Items**:
  - Acceptance criteria (prefixed with âœ“)
  - Subtasks (prefixed with â€¢)
- **Comments**: Metadata like priority, estimated hours, dependencies

## Key Insights

1. **Task names are AI-generated** based on PRD analysis and context
2. **Instructions are generated separately** when tasks are assigned to agents
3. **The description stored in Planka** is the initial task description, not the full instructions
4. **Full instructions are only generated** when an agent requests the task
5. **Instructions are enhanced** with context, dependencies, and predictions at assignment time

## Identified Issues

### The Truncation Problem
The **truncated description** ending with "...kjjkj" appears to be happening in stage 4, where the AI generates the task description. This could be due to:
1. Token limits in the AI response
2. String truncation in the processing
3. A bug in the task enhancement process

The **instructions** (stage 8) are much more detailed because they're generated separately with a different prompt specifically for the agent when they request work.

## Potential Solutions

1. **Fix the truncation issue** - Debug the AI task generation to prevent description truncation
2. **Add instructions to the card** - Modify task creation to include both description AND instructions
3. **Use comments for detailed instructions** - Extend metadata comments to include full instructions
4. **Improve task description generation** - Enhance the AI prompts to generate better initial descriptions

## Full Example: CLI Todo App

### 1. User Input
```python
create_project(
    description="Create a simple CLI todo app with features like adding tasks, listing tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks",

### 6. When Agent Requests This Task

**Generated Instructions (NOT in Planka):**
```
Since the task type is "design", here are the instructions:

# Design Add Tasks

**Objective:** Plan and design the architecture and specifications for allowing users to add new tasks to the todo list in the CLI application.

**Steps:**

1. **Define Data Model**
   - Design the data structure to represent a task
   - Required fields: id (unique identifier), description (task text), status (complete/incomplete), created_at (timestamp)
   - Consider optional fields: due_date, priority, tags
   - Document as Python dataclass or dictionary structure

2. **Plan CLI Command Syntax**
   - Design intuitive command: `todo add "Task description"`
   - Consider options: `--priority high`, `--due tomorrow`
   - Document all command variations and options

3. **Design Storage Format**
   - Specify JSON structure for tasks file
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "tasks": [
         {
           "id": "uuid-here",
           "description": "Buy groceries",
           "status": "incomplete",
           "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

4. **Plan Error Handling**
   - Empty task description
   - File access errors
   - Duplicate task handling

5. **Document Design Decisions**
   - Create a design document with all specifications
   - Include data flow diagram
   - Justify technology choices

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Detailed design documentation covering data model, CLI syntax, and storage format
- Error scenarios documented with handling strategies
- Clear specifications that can be directly implemented

**Dependencies:**
- Understanding of Click framework for Python CLI apps
- Knowledge of JSON file handling in Python

ðŸ”— DEPENDENCY AWARENESS:
2 future tasks depend on your work:
- Test List Tasks (needs: Documented endpoints with example requests/responses for testing)
- Test Add Tasks (needs: Documented endpoints with example requests/responses for testing)

Consider these future needs when making implementation decisions.
```

### 7. The Truncation Issue

In your case, the description is showing as:
```
"Research and design architecture for data analytics platform. Create documentation defining approach, patterns, and specifications. Plan component structure and integration points. Deliverables: design documentation, architectural diagrams, and technical specifications. Goal: Provide a simple and efficient way to manage tasks and todo lists. Specific requirement: Allow users to add new tasks to the todo list...kjjkj"
```

This appears to be:
1. A mix of generic task description template
2. Partially correct content about todo lists
3. Truncated ending with "...kjjkj"

The issue is likely in the `_generate_design_task()` method where the AI response is being truncated or corrupted during processing.
