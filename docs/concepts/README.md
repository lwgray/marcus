# Concepts

This section explains **what** Marcus is and **why** it works the way it does. These documents provide high-level understanding without implementation details.

## Purpose

Learn Marcus's design philosophy, core principles, and fundamental concepts. Perfect for understanding the "big picture" before diving into how-to guides or technical systems.

## Audience

- New users wanting to understand Marcus
- Developers evaluating Marcus for their projects
- Anyone interested in multi-agent coordination philosophy
- Researchers studying AI agent systems

## Documents

### **[Philosophy](philosophy.md)**
Marcus's Stoic approach to multi-agent software development. Learn about BYOA (Bring Your Own Agent), context over control, and why randomness is a feature.

### **[Core Values](core-values.md)**

- **Projects** - Structured collections with phases
- **Kanban Boards** - Visual project management
- **Context System** - Rich task understanding
- **Dependencies** - Task relationships and ordering
