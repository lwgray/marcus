# Core Concepts

This guide introduces the fundamental concepts you need to understand to work with Marcus effectively.

## Overview

Marcus orchestrates AI agents to work autonomously on software development projects. Understanding these core concepts will help you use Marcus effectively and understand its capabilities.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Agents**

**What they are**: AI workers (Claude, GPT, Gemini, or custom models) that autonomously complete tasks.

**How they work**:
- Register with Marcus once at startup
- Request tasks from Marcus
- Work independently with full context
- Report progress and blockers
- Complete tasks and immediately request more work

**Key characteristics**:
- **Autonomous** - Work independently without constant supervision
- **Ephemeral** - Can start/stop as needed; Marcus maintains continuity
- **Context-aware** - Receive rich context about dependencies and related work
- **Accountable** - All work is logged and traceable

### 2. **Tasks**

**What they are**: Units of work with clear objectives, dependencies, and success criteria.

**Task structure**:
```
Task
├── Name/Description - What needs to be done
├── Phase - Planning, Development, Testing, Deployment
├── Dependencies - Tasks that must complete first
├── Assigned Agent - Who's working on it
├── Status - Todo, In Progress, Completed
├── Context - Implementation guidance and related decisions
└── Predictions - Estimated completion time, risk factors
```

**Task lifecycle**:
1. **Created** - From project description or manually
2. **Available** - Ready to be assigned (dependencies met)
3. **Assigned** - Agent receives task with context
4. **In Progress** - Agent working, reporting progress
5. **Completed** - Verified and closed

**Key characteristics**:
- **Context-rich** - Include implementation context from related tasks
- **Dependency-aware** - Know what must be done first
- **Intelligently assigned** - Matched to agent skills and availability
- **Predictable** - Marcus predicts completion time and risk

### 3. **Projects**

**What they are**: Structured collections of related tasks with phases, dependencies, and goals.

**Project structure**:
```
Project
├── Name/Description - What you're building
├── Phases - Logical groupings (Planning → Dev → Test → Deploy)
├── Tasks - Individual units of work
├── Dependencies - Inter-task relationships
├── Agents - Team working on the project
├── Board - Kanban board representation
└── Metrics - Health, progress, predictions
```

**How projects are created**:
1. **Natural Language** - Describe your project in plain English
2. **Marcus NLP Engine** - Parses description into structured components
3. **Task Generation** - Creates tasks with intelligent dependencies
4. **Board Creation** - Sets up Kanban board with phases

**Key characteristics**:
- **Phase-based** - Organized into logical workflow stages
- **Dependency-managed** - Tasks ordered for optimal flow
- **Health-monitored** - Continuous analysis of project status
- **Predictive** - Timeline forecasts and risk analysis

### 4. **Kanban Boards**

**What they are**: The shared task store that mediates all coordination. Every action — task creation, assignment, progress, decisions, artifacts — lives on the board.

**Supported providers**:

| Provider          | Status     | Notes |
|-------------------|------------|-------|
| **SQLite**        | Default    | Zero-setup. No Docker, no external services. Marcus creates `data/kanban.db` automatically on first project. Recommended for solo and experimentation. |
| **Planka**        | Stable     | Self-hosted drag-and-drop UI. Requires Docker (Planka + Postgres only — Marcus still runs locally). |
| **GitHub Projects** | Alpha    | Provider exists; end-to-end testing pending. |
| **Linear**        | Alpha      | Provider exists; end-to-end testing pending. |

> Trello and Jira providers are **not supported** — they are deferred until a real user request lands.

**How Marcus uses the board**:
- **Single source of truth** — all task status, context, and history live here
- **Communication medium** — agents log decisions and artifacts to the board, not to each other
- **Visibility layer** — Cato (the dashboard) reads the board for real-time UI
- **Audit trail** — complete history of what happened, who did it, and why

**Key characteristics**:
- **Pluggable** — pick the provider that fits your team
- **Board-only communication** — no agent-to-agent messaging
- **Crash-resilient** — agent failure doesn't lose work; the next agent picks up where the last one stopped
- **Inspectable** — `./marcus board` shows the current state from the terminal

### 5. **Context System**

**What it is**: Marcus's system for providing agents with comprehensive task understanding.

**What context includes**:
- **Task details** - Description, requirements, success criteria
- **Dependencies** - What was done before, what depends on this
- **Implementation patterns** - Similar tasks, successful approaches
- **Architectural decisions** - Choices made by other agents
- **Risk factors** - Potential blockers, complexity assessment
- **Predictions** - Expected timeline, confidence levels

**How context is built**:
1. **Dependency analysis** - Examines related tasks
2. **Historical patterns** - Finds similar completed tasks
3. **Decision aggregation** - Collects relevant logged decisions
4. **AI enrichment** - Adds intelligent guidance
5. **Predictive insights** - Includes completion forecasts

**Key benefits**:
- **Reduces back-and-forth** - Agents have everything needed upfront
- **Ensures consistency** - Follows established patterns
- **Prevents conflicts** - Aware of other agents' work
- **Enables autonomy** - Work independently with confidence

### 6. **Dependencies**

**What they are**: Relationships between tasks that define execution order.

**Types of dependencies**:
- **Explicit** - Manually defined "Task B needs Task A first"
- **Inferred** - AI detects implicit dependencies (e.g., "API implementation" before "frontend integration")
- **Phase-based** - Planning before Development before Testing

**How dependencies work**:
- **Automatic inference** - Marcus uses AI to detect dependencies
- **Validation** - Prevents circular dependencies
- **Enforcement** - Tasks only available when dependencies complete
- **Optimization** - Identifies tasks that can run in parallel

**Key characteristics**:
- **Intelligent** - AI understands semantic relationships
- **Validated** - Prevents logical impossibilities
- **Flexible** - Can be adjusted when needed
- **Optimized** - Maximizes parallel work

### 7. **Memory & Learning**

**What it is**: Marcus's four-tier system for learning and improvement.

**Memory tiers**:

1. **Working Memory** - Immediate project state
   - Current agents, tasks, blockers
   - Real-time project metrics
   - Active coordination needs

2. **Episodic Memory** - Event history
   - What happened, when, and why
   - Agent actions and outcomes
   - Project timeline

3. **Semantic Memory** - General knowledge
   - Agent skill patterns
   - Task type characteristics
   - Successful coordination patterns

4. **Procedural Memory** - Process optimization
   - Best practices for task types
   - Optimal agent assignment strategies
   - Effective blocker resolution patterns

**How learning works**:
- **Pattern recognition** - Identifies what works well
- **Predictive improvement** - Better forecasts over time
- **Recommendation enhancement** - Smarter suggestions
- **Process optimization** - Continuous workflow improvement

### 8. **AI Intelligence Engine**

**What it is**: Marcus's hybrid system combining rules and AI for intelligent decisions.

**What it powers**:
- **Task assignment** - Match tasks to optimal agents
- **Context building** - Generate rich task context
- **Dependency inference** - Detect implicit dependencies
- **Blocker resolution** - Suggest solutions when agents stuck
- **Risk prediction** - Identify potential problems early
- **Timeline forecasting** - Predict completion times

**How it works**:
- **Rules for safety** - Prevent illogical actions
- **AI for intelligence** - Understand semantic meaning
- **Fallbacks for reliability** - Continue if AI unavailable
- **Learning for improvement** - Gets smarter with each project

**Key benefits**:
- **Intelligent matching** - Right agent for each task
- **Proactive problem-solving** - Anticipates issues
- **Adaptive optimization** - Learns from experience
- **Reliable operation** - Functions even without AI

### 9. **The Marcus Ecosystem**

Marcus the orchestration server is the core, but several sibling tools layer on top of it:

- **`/marcus` skill** — Claude Code skill (`skills/marcus/SKILL.md`) that wraps experiment setup into one command. Spawns N independent Claude CLI agents in tmux panes, each registering with the Marcus MCP server. The fastest path from idea → multi-agent run.
- **[Cato](https://github.com/lwgray/cato)** — the active visual dashboard. Real-time agent activity, kanban view, board health. Sibling product; install separately and point at the same data store.
- **[Posidonius](https://github.com/lwgray/posidonius)** — multi-run experiment platform. Launches and monitors batches of independent Marcus runs (parameter sweeps, benchmarks, parallel projects). Web UI plus integration with Epictetus for grading agent output.
- **Epictetus** — code auditor that grades software projects (and the agents that built them). Wired into the Posidonius pipeline as a post-run audit.

Marcus the orchestration server is required for all of the above. The dashboard, experiment platform, and grader are optional layers.
