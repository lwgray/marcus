# Marcus Communication Hub System

## Overview

The Communication Hub is Marcus's multi-channel notification and messaging system designed to keep agents, managers, and stakeholders informed about task assignments, blockers, project status, and coordination activities. It serves as the central communication orchestrator, ensuring that critical information flows efficiently across different channels (Slack, email, kanban comments) while respecting agent preferences and escalation protocols.

## System Architecture

### Core Design Philosophy

The Communication Hub implements a **channel-agnostic messaging pattern** where message content is formatted appropriately for each communication medium. This design ensures:

- **Unified Message Creation**: Single source of truth for notification content
- **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Parallel message dispatch across all enabled channels
- **Graceful Degradation**: Channel failures don't affect other communication paths
- **Agent Personalization**: Customizable communication preferences per agent

### Core Components

#### 1. CommunicationHub Class (`src/communication/communication_hub.py`)

The main orchestrator that manages all communication flows:

```python
class CommunicationHub:
    """
    Multi-channel communication system for team coordination.

    Manages notifications across Slack, email, and kanban channels
    with agent-specific preferences and escalation protocols.
    """
```

**Key Attributes:**
- `settings`: Configuration instance with channel enablement flags
- `message_queue`: Async message processing queue
- `agent_preferences`: Per-agent communication customization
- Channel flags: `slack_enabled`, `email_enabled`, `kanban_comments_enabled`

#### 2. Message Formatting Engine

The hub implements sophisticated message formatting that adapts content for each channel:

- **Kanban Comments**: Markdown-formatted with structured metadata
- **Slack Messages**: Rich text with emojis and action prompts
- **Email**: HTML-formatted with professional styling

#### 3. Parallel Delivery System

Uses `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent message delivery:

```python
tasks = []
if self.kanban_comments_enabled:
    tasks.append(self._send_kanban_comment(task_id, message["kanban"]))
if self.slack_enabled:
    tasks.append(self._send_slack_message(agent_id, message["slack"]))
if self.email_enabled:
    tasks.append(self._send_email(agent_id, "Subject", message["email"]))

await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

## Integration with Marcus Ecosystem

### Workflow Integration Points

The Communication Hub is invoked at critical junctures in the Marcus workflow:

1. **Agent Registration** → Welcome messages and preference setup
2. **Task Assignment** → Multi-channel assignment notifications
3. **Progress Reporting** → Status updates to stakeholders
4. **Blocker Reports** → Escalation notifications with AI-suggested resolutions
5. **Task Completion** → Success notifications and metrics updates
6. **Daily Planning** → Personalized work plans and recommendations

### MCP Server Integration

The Communication Hub is instantiated within the MCP Server (`src/marcus_mcp/server.py`):

```python
class MarcusServer:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... other components
        self.comm_hub = CommunicationHub()
```

However, the current implementation shows the Communication Hub is **prepared but not yet fully integrated** into the active workflow. The MCP server instantiates it but doesn't actively use it in the current tool implementations.

### Event-Driven Integration

The Communication Hub is designed to integrate with Marcus's Event-Driven Architecture:

- **Event Subscribers**: Listens for task_assigned, blocker_reported, task_completed events
- **Notification Triggers**: Automatically sends appropriate communications
- **Escalation Events**: Publishes escalation events for management systems

## Typical Workflow Position

In the standard Marcus workflow, the Communication Hub operates as a **cross-cutting service**:

```
create_project → register_agent → request_next_task → report_progress → report_blocker → finish_task
      ↓              ↓                   ↓                ↓              ↓              ↓
   [Welcome]    [Registration]    [Assignment]      [Updates]      [Escalation]   [Completion]
      ↓              ↓                   ↓                ↓              ↓              ↓
      └──────────────────────── Communication Hub ───────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Specific Invocation Points

1. **Agent Registration**: `notify_agent_welcome()` (planned)
2. **Task Assignment**: `notify_task_assignment(agent_id, assignment)`
3. **Progress Updates**: `notify_progress_update()` (planned)
4. **Blocker Reports**: `notify_blocker(agent_id, task_id, description, resolution_plan)`
5. **Escalations**: `escalate_blocker(blocker, resolution)`
6. **Task Unblocking**: `notify_task_unblocked(task)`
7. **Daily Planning**: `send_daily_plan(agent_id, recommendations)`

## What Makes This System Special

### 1. Channel-Agnostic Message Design

Unlike traditional notification systems that format for a single channel, the Communication Hub creates **semantically rich messages** that are then adapted for each medium:

```python
def _format_assignment_message(self, agent_id: str, assignment: TaskAssignment) -> Dict[str, str]:
    return {
        "kanban": "📋 Task assigned...",    # Markdown with metadata
        "slack": "🎯 *New Task Assignment*", # Rich text with actions
        "email": "<h2>New Task Assignment</h2>" # HTML with styling
    }
```

### 2. Intelligent Recipient Resolution

The system dynamically determines notification recipients based on:
- **Resolution Plan Context**: Who needs to be involved in resolving blockers
- **Escalation Hierarchy**: Management chains for critical issues
- **Agent Preferences**: Individual communication preferences
- **Resource Requirements**: Specific people mentioned in resolution plans

### 3. Asynchronous Resilience

Communications are sent in parallel with exception isolation, ensuring that:
- Slack failures don't prevent email delivery
- Kanban comment failures don't block direct notifications
- Failed channels are logged but don't halt the workflow

### 4. Preference-Driven Personalization

Agents can customize their communication experience:

```python
hub.set_agent_preferences("agent-001", {
    "daily_plan_channel": "email",
    "notification_hours": "09:00-17:00",
    "quiet_mode": False
})
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Message Queue Architecture

The Communication Hub implements an async message queue for handling high-volume notifications:

```python
self.message_queue: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []
```

This enables:
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple messages can be queued and sent together
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents API overload for external services
- **Retry Logic**: Failed messages can be requeued
- **Priority Handling**: Urgent messages can jump the queue

### Error Handling Strategy

The system implements **graceful degradation** through exception catching:

```python
await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

Benefits:
- **Isolation**: One channel failure doesn't affect others
- **Logging**: Failures are captured for debugging
- **Monitoring**: Channel health can be tracked
- **Fallbacks**: Alternative channels can be prioritized when primary fails

### Channel Abstraction

Each communication channel implements a consistent interface:

```python
async def _send_kanban_comment(self, task_id: str, comment: str) -> None
async def _send_slack_message(self, recipient: str, message: str) -> None
async def _send_email(self, recipient: str, subject: str, body: str) -> None
```

This abstraction allows for:
- **Easy Extension**: New channels (Teams, Discord) can be added easily
- **Testing**: Channels can be mocked for unit testing
- **Configuration**: Channels can be enabled/disabled per environment

### State Management

The Communication Hub maintains minimal state:
- **Agent Preferences**: Persistent across sessions
- **Message Queue**: In-memory for performance
- **Channel Configuration**: Loaded from settings

## Current Implementation Pros and Cons

### Advantages

1. **Scalable Architecture**: Well-designed for adding new channels
2. **Resilient Design**: Graceful handling of channel failures
3. **Personalization Ready**: Framework for agent-specific preferences
4. **Rich Formatting**: Channel-appropriate message formatting
5. **Async Performance**: Non-blocking parallel delivery
6. **Extensible Pattern**: Easy to add new notification types

### Limitations

1. **Simulated Channels**: Current implementation prints to console instead of actual delivery
2. **Missing Integration**: Not yet connected to active Marcus workflows
3. **No Persistence**: Message queue and preferences not persisted
4. **Limited Escalation Logic**: Basic escalation rules need enhancement
5. **No Rate Limiting**: Could overwhelm external APIs in high-volume scenarios
6. **Missing Analytics**: No tracking of delivery success/failure rates

### Current Simulation State

All communication channels are currently **simulated**:

```python
async def _send_slack_message(self, recipient: str, message: str) -> None:
    # This would integrate with Slack SDK
    # For now, we'll simulate it
    print(f"[SLACK] To {recipient}: {message}")
```
