# Architecture Overview

High-level system architecture and core infrastructure components.

## Core Infrastructure Systems

### **[06 - MCP Server](06-mcp-server.md)**
Model Context Protocol server implementation for AI agent integration. Exposes Marcus's capabilities through standardized MCP tools.

### **[09 - Event-Driven Architecture](09-event-driven-architecture.md)**
Publish/subscribe system enabling loose coupling between components. All system interactions flow through events for scalability and observability.

### **[15 - Service Registry](15-service-registry.md)**
Dynamic service discovery and health management. Enables flexible system composition and runtime reconfiguration.

### **[39 - Task Execution Order Fix Architecture](39-task-execution-order-fix-architecture.md)**
Architecture for ensuring correct task execution ordering based on dependencies.

### **[40 - Enhanced Ping Tool](40-enhanced-ping-tool.md)**
Intelligent connectivity verification with client-specific health information.
