Marcus AI Documentation
========================

**Board-Mediated Coordination for AI Coding Agents**

Marcus is an open-source orchestration server that lets multiple AI agents collaborate
on software projects through a shared kanban board — never through chat. Any
MCP-compatible agent works: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Kimi, AutoGen, LangGraph,
or a custom runtime.

Why Marcus?

    .. tab-item:: Board-Mediated Coordination

        Agents pull from a shared kanban board — no group chats, no message passing.
        A modern take on the classical Blackboard pattern (Hayes-Roth, 1985), applied
        to autonomous LLM agents over MCP. Context is preserved per-task; failures
        recover from board state; throughput scales with the number of agents.

    .. tab-item:: Bring Your Own Agent

        Any MCP-compatible runtime works: Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Kimi,
        AutoGen, LangGraph, or a custom agent. Two operating modes:
        **Runner mode** (one-command via the ``/marcus`` skill in Claude Code) and
        **Attach mode** (any agent connects to ``http://localhost:4298/mcp``).

    .. tab-item:: SQLite by Default

        Zero-setup kanban — Marcus creates ``data/kanban.db`` on first project.
        No Docker, no Postgres, no external services. Optional providers: Planka
        (drag-and-drop UI via Docker), GitHub Projects, Linear.

    .. tab-item:: Built-in Observability

        Every action is on the board: tasks, dependencies, decisions, artifacts,
        progress. Pair with **Cato** for a real-time dashboard, **Posidonius** for
        multi-run experiments, and **Epictetus** for post-run grading.


Quick Example
-------------

The fastest path from idea to working software, using the ``/marcus`` skill in Claude Code:

.. code-block:: bash

    # One-time install
    git clone https://github.com/lwgray/marcus.git
    cd marcus && pip install -e .
    cp -r skills/marcus ~/.claude/skills/marcus

    # Configure your LLM provider
    cp .env.example .env
    cp config_marcus.example.json config_marcus.json
    # Edit .env: set CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

    # Start Marcus
    ./marcus start

    # Inside Claude Code, in your project directory:
    #   /marcus Build a todo app with authentication using 3 agents
    #
    # The skill registers the MCP server, injects the agent prompt,
    # decomposes the project, and spawns 3 agents in tmux panes.

For other runtimes (Codex, Gemini CLI, AutoGen, custom), use **Attach mode** — connect
your agent to ``http://localhost:4298/mcp`` and follow the work loop in
``prompts/Agent_prompt.md``. See `PROTOCOL.md
<https://github.com/lwgray/marcus/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md>`_ for the full agent protocol spec.
