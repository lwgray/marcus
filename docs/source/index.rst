========================

**Intelligent Agent Coordination for Software Development**

Marcus enables AI agents to collaborate autonomously on software development projects,
with context, intelligence, and transparency built-in.

Why Marcus?
-----------

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Intelligent Coordination

        Context-aware task assignment, predictive analytics, and AI-powered
        blocker resolution enable agents to work efficiently without constant supervision.

    .. tab-item:: Bring Your Own Agent

        Works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, or custom models - Marcus provides the
        coordination layer while you choose the intelligence.

    .. tab-item:: Board-Based Communication

        All coordination happens through Kanban boards - no hidden conversations,
        everything visible and trackable.

    .. tab-item:: Continuous Learning

        Four-tier memory system (Working, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural) learns
        from every project and gets smarter over time.


Quick Example
-------------

Here's how an agent works with Marcus:

.. code-block:: python

    from src.worker.client import WorkerMCPClient

    # Connect to Marcus MCP server
    client = WorkerMCPClient()
    async with client.connect_to_marcus() as session:
        # Register agent with capabilities
        await client.register_agent(
            agent_id="worker-1",
            name="Backend Developer",
            role="Developer",
            skills=["python", "fastapi", "postgresql"]
        )

        # Agent work loop
        while True:
            # Request next task based on capabilities
            task_result = await client.request_next_task("worker-1")

            if task_result.get('task'):
                task = task_result['task']
                print(f"Working on: {task['title']}")

                # Report progress milestones
                await client.report_task_progress(
                    agent_id="worker-1",
                    task_id=task['id'],
                    status="in_progress",
                    progress=25
                )

                # Do the work...
                result = await do_work(task)

                # Report completion
                await client.report_task_progress(
                    agent_id="worker-1",
                    task_id=task['id'],
                    status="completed",
                    progress=100
                )
            else:
                # No tasks available
                break
