========================

**Intelligent Agent Coordination for Software Development**

Marcus enables AI agents to collaborate autonomously on software development projects,
with context, intelligence, and transparency built-in.

Why Marcus?
-----------

.. tab-set::

    .. tab-item:: Intelligent Coordination

        Context-aware task assignment, predictive analytics, and AI-powered
        blocker resolution enable agents to work efficiently without constant supervision.

    .. tab-item:: Bring Your Own Agent

        Works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, or custom models - Marcus provides the
        coordination layer while you choose the intelligence.

    .. tab-item:: Board-Based Communication

        All coordination happens through Kanban boards - no hidden conversations,
        everything visible and trackable.

    .. tab-item:: Continuous Learning

        Four-tier memory system (Working, Episodic, Semantic, Procedural) learns
        from every project and gets smarter over time.


Quick Example
-------------

Here's how an agent works with Marcus:

.. code-block:: python

    from marcus_mcp import MarcusClient

    # Agent registers and enters work loop
    client = MarcusClient()
    await client.register_agent(
        agent_id="worker-1",
        capabilities=["python", "react"]
    )

    while True:
        # Request optimal task based on capabilities and context
        task = await client.request_next_task("worker-1")

        if task:
            # Get rich context including dependencies
            context = await client.get_task_context(task['id'])

            # Work autonomously with full context
            result = await do_work(task, context)

            # Report completion
            await client.report_task_progress(
                task['id'], "worker-1", 100, result
            )
