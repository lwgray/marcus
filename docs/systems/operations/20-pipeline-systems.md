### Position in Typical Workflow

The Pipeline Systems integrate seamlessly into the standard Marcus workflow:

```
create_project → register_agent → request_next_task → report_progress → report_blocker → finish_task
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                   ↓                ↓             ↓
Pipeline Start → Agent Events → Task Events → Progress Events → Blocker Events → Completion
```

#### Flow Lifecycle Events

```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Event-Driven Architecture

The Pipeline Systems use a sophisticated event-driven architecture:

#### Event Types and Stages

```python
class PipelineStage(Enum):
    MCP_REQUEST = "mcp_request"
    AI_ANALYSIS = "ai_analysis"
    PRD_PARSING = "prd_parsing"
    TASK_GENERATION = "task_generation"
    TASK_CREATION = "task_creation"
    TASK_ASSIGNMENT = "task_assignment"
    WORK_PROGRESS = "work_progress"
    TASK_COMPLETION = "task_completion"
```

Each event contains:
- **flow_id**: Unique pipeline identifier
- **stage**: Current processing stage
- **event_type**: Specific event category
- **timestamp**: Precise timing information
- **duration_ms**: Performance metrics
- **data**: Rich contextual information
- **status**: Success/failure/in-progress
- **error**: Failure details if applicable

#### Event Storage Strategy

Events are stored in a hierarchical JSON structure:

```json
{
  "flows": {
    "flow_id": {
      "project_name": "string",
      "started_at": "ISO_timestamp",
      "completed_at": "ISO_timestamp",
      "metadata": {}
    }
  },
  "events": [
    {
      "flow_id": "string",
      "stage": "string",
      "event_type": "string",
      "timestamp": "ISO_timestamp",
      "duration_ms": "number",
      "data": {},
      "status": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

### What-If Analysis Implementation

The What-If Analysis Engine provides sophisticated scenario modeling:

#### Parameter Modification System

```python
@dataclass
class PipelineModification:
    parameter: str           # Parameter to modify
    original_value: Any      # Current value
    new_value: Any          # Proposed value
    description: str        # Human-readable description
```

#### Simulation Engine

The simulation engine models parameter impacts:

```python
# Team size modifications
if parameter == "team_size":
    if new_value > original_value:
        metrics["task_count"] *= 1.2      # More parallel work
        metrics["complexity"] *= 1.1      # Coordination overhead
    else:
        metrics["task_count"] *= 0.9      # Less parallel work
        metrics["complexity"] *= 0.95     # Simpler coordination

# AI model modifications
if parameter == "ai_model":
    if new_value == "gpt-3.5":
        metrics["cost"] *= 0.1            # Much cheaper
        metrics["quality"] *= 0.85        # Slightly lower quality
        metrics["duration"] *= 0.7        # Faster
    elif new_value == "claude":
        metrics["cost"] *= 1.2            # More expensive
        metrics["quality"] *= 1.05        # Higher quality
```

### Pipeline Comparison Algorithm

The comparison system analyzes multiple flows to identify patterns:

#### Multi-Dimensional Analysis

1. **Performance Comparison**:
   - Duration analysis (min, max, average)
   - Cost optimization opportunities
   - Token efficiency metrics

2. **Quality Assessment**:
   - Quality score distributions
   - Confidence level analysis
   - Missing consideration patterns

3. **Decision Pattern Mining**:
   - Common decision points across flows
   - Unique approaches and their outcomes
   - Confidence correlation analysis

4. **Task Pattern Analysis**:
   - Task categorization (testing, documentation, implementation)
   - Workload distribution patterns
   - Complexity correlation studies

### Real-Time Monitoring Implementation

The Live Pipeline Monitor provides sophisticated real-time tracking:

#### Progress Calculation Algorithm

```python
def calculate_progress(self, flow_id: str, events: List[Dict]) -> float:
    # Stage-based progress
    stages_completed = set(event.get("stage") for event in events)
    expected_stages = ["mcp_request", "ai_analysis", "prd_parsing",
                      "task_generation", "task_creation", "task_completion"]
    stage_progress = len(stages_completed) / len(expected_stages) * 100

    # Event-based progress
    avg_events = statistics.mean(self.historical_data["avg_events_per_flow"])
    event_progress = min(len(events) / avg_events * 100, 95)

    # Weighted combination
    return min((stage_progress + event_progress) / 2, 95)
```

#### Health Monitoring System

The health monitor tracks multiple indicators:

- **Error Rate**: Frequency of failed events
- **Performance Degradation**: Stages running significantly slower than historical averages
- **Stall Detection**: Periods without event activity
- **Resource Utilization**: Token usage and cost trends

#### ETA Prediction

Completion time estimation uses multiple approaches:

1. **Linear Projection**: Based on current progress rate
2. **Historical Analysis**: Comparison with similar past flows
3. **Stage-Based Estimation**: Remaining stages and their typical durations
