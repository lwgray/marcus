# Persistence Layer Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Persistence Layer is Marcus's unified storage abstraction system that provides consistent data access patterns across all Marcus components. It implements a pluggable backend architecture supporting multiple storage engines (file-based JSON, SQLite, in-memory) with thread-safe concurrent access, atomic operations, and automatic timestamp management. This system serves as the foundational data layer enabling Marcus's memory system, event distribution, context management, and project registry to maintain state across system restarts.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`PersistenceBackend` (Abstract Base Class)**
   - Defines the storage interface contract
   - Standardizes operations: store, retrieve, query, delete, clear_old
   - Enables pluggable backend implementations
   - Ensures consistent API across different storage engines

2. **`FilePersistence` (Primary Backend)**
   - JSON-based file storage implementation
   - Atomic writes using temporary files and atomic rename operations
   - Per-collection file locking for concurrent access
   - Automatic timestamp injection (`_stored_at`)
   - Graceful error handling with rollback mechanisms

3. **`SQLitePersistence` (Performance Backend)**
   - SQLite-based storage for better performance and complex queries
   - Asynchronous executor pattern for non-blocking database operations
   - Indexed storage with efficient timestamp-based queries
   - ACID compliance for data integrity

4. **`MemoryPersistence` (Testing Backend)**
   - In-memory storage for unit tests and ephemeral operations
   - Full feature parity with persistent backends
   - Fast reset capabilities for test isolation

5. **`Persistence` (Unified Interface)**
   - High-level facade wrapping backend implementations
   - Domain-specific methods for Events, Decisions, and arbitrary data
   - Built-in cleanup and maintenance operations
   - Type-safe object reconstruction from stored data

### Storage Architecture

```python
# Backend Abstraction Layer
PersistenceBackend (ABC)
├── FilePersistence      # JSON files with atomic writes
├── SQLitePersistence    # SQLite database with indexing
└── MemoryPersistence    # In-memory for testing

# Domain Layer
Persistence (Facade)
├── Event storage/retrieval methods
├── Decision storage/retrieval methods
├── Generic collection operations
└── Cleanup and maintenance
```

### Data Organization

**File Backend Structure:**
```
data/marcus_state/
├── events.json          # Event distribution history
├── decisions.json       # Architectural decisions
├── projects.json        # Project registry data
├── implementations.json # Code pattern storage
└── patterns.json        # Learned behavioral patterns
```

**SQLite Backend Structure:**
```sql
persistence(
    collection TEXT,     -- Logical grouping (events, decisions, etc.)
    key TEXT,           -- Unique identifier within collection
    data TEXT,          -- JSON-serialized object data
    stored_at TIMESTAMP -- Automatic timestamp for cleanup/queries
)
```

## Integration with Marcus Ecosystem

- Stores decision context for future reference

### 6. `finish_task` → **Outcome Recording and Learning**
- Records complete task outcomes
- Updates agent performance profiles
- Triggers pattern learning and storage

## Key Features

### 1. Thread-Safe Concurrent Access
```python
# Per-collection locking prevents race conditions
self._locks = {}  # collection -> asyncio.Lock()
async with self._get_lock(collection):
    # Atomic operation guaranteed
```

### 2. Atomic Write Operations
```python
# Atomic file replacement prevents corruption
temp_file = file_path.with_suffix(".tmp")
await write_to_temp_file(temp_file, data)
temp_file.replace(file_path)  # Atomic on POSIX systems
```

### 3. Automatic Timestamping
```python
# All stored data gets automatic timestamp
data_with_timestamp = {
    **original_data,
    "_stored_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
}
```

### 4. Flexible Querying
```python
# Filter functions enable complex queries
def filter_recent_errors(item):
    return (item.get("event_type") == "error" and
            item.get("timestamp") > cutoff_time)

events = await persistence.query("events", filter_recent_errors)
```

### 5. Intelligent Cleanup
```python
# Automatic cleanup of old data with configurable retention
await persistence.cleanup(days=30)  # Remove data older than 30 days
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Asynchronous Operations
All persistence operations are asynchronous to prevent blocking:
```python
# File operations use aiofiles for non-blocking I/O
async with aiofiles.open(file_path, "w") as f:
    await f.write(json.dumps(data))

# SQLite operations use executor pattern
await asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(None, sync_operation)
```

### Error Handling and Resilience
```python
# Graceful error handling with detailed logging
try:
    await storage_operation()
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Storage error in {collection}: {e}")
    # Rollback temporary files if needed
    if temp_file.exists():
        temp_file.unlink()
    raise
```

### JSON Serialization Strategy
```python
# Custom serialization handles complex types
json.dumps(data, indent=2, default=str)  # Fallback to string representation
```

### Backend Selection Logic
```python
# Automatic backend selection based on feature requirements
if any(enhanced_features_enabled):
    # Use SQLite for better performance with complex queries
    backend = SQLitePersistence(Path(persistence_path))
else:
    # Use simple file backend for basic operations
    backend = FilePersistence()
```

## Performance Characteristics

### File Backend Performance
- **Read Operations**: O(1) for single key, O(n) for collection queries
- **Write Operations**: O(n) due to full file rewrite (atomic safety)
- **Memory Usage**: Loads entire collection into memory for operations
- **Concurrency**: Per-collection locking, good for low-contention scenarios

### SQLite Backend Performance
- **Read Operations**: O(log n) with indexed queries
- **Write Operations**: O(1) with transaction batching
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal memory footprint with cursor-based iteration
- **Concurrency**: Row-level locking, excellent for high-contention scenarios

### Memory Backend Performance
- **Read Operations**: O(1) dictionary access
- **Write Operations**: O(1) dictionary update
- **Memory Usage**: All data in memory, fast but volatile
- **Concurrency**: Async lock-based, ideal for testing

## Simple vs Complex Task Handling

### Simple Task Operations
For basic task tracking and single-agent workflows:
- **File Backend**: Sufficient for small datasets (< 1000 records)
- **Minimal Querying**: Simple key-based lookups dominate
- **Low Concurrency**: Single agent, sequential operations

### Complex Task Operations
For advanced features and multi-agent coordination:
- **SQLite Backend**: Required for performance with large datasets
- **Complex Queries**: Time-based filtering, pattern matching, aggregations
- **High Concurrency**: Multiple agents accessing shared data simultaneously

## Board-Specific Considerations

- **Card Metadata**: Stores Planka card IDs and board structure
- **Sync State**: Tracks synchronization timestamps and conflicts
- **Attachment Handling**: Persists file references and metadata

### Linear Integration
