# Visualization & UI Systems

## Overview

The Marcus Visualization & UI Systems provide a sophisticated event tracking, pipeline monitoring, and workflow visualization infrastructure that bridges the gap between Marcus's internal operations and external visualization tools. The system has evolved from a monolithic visualization component to a lightweight, modular event logging architecture that integrates seamlessly with external visualization systems like Seneca.

## Architecture

### System Components

The visualization system consists of seven primary components:

1. **Event Integrated Visualizer** (`event_integrated_visualizer.py`) - Core event aggregation
2. **Pipeline Flow Manager** (`pipeline_flow.py`) - Workflow state tracking
3. **Pipeline Manager** (`pipeline_manager.py`) - High-level pipeline orchestration
4. **Pipeline Replay Controller** (`pipeline_replay.py`) - Historical event replay
5. **Conversation Adapter** (`conversation_adapter.py`) - Agent event bridge
6. **Pipeline Conversation Bridge** (`pipeline_conversation_bridge.py`) - Conversation-pipeline integration
7. **Shared Pipeline Events** (`shared_pipeline_events.py`) - Core event infrastructure

### Data Flow Architecture

```
Agent Events → Conversation Logger → Pipeline Events → External Visualization (Seneca)
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                      ↓
Event Storage → Structured Logs → Event Stream → Real-time Dashboard
```

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Core Event Infrastructure (`shared_pipeline_events.py`)

The foundation of the system is built around lightweight event capture:

```python
class SharedPipelineEvents:
    """Minimal stub for pipeline event tracking"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.events = []

    def log_event(self, event_type: str, data: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Log a pipeline event"""
        event = {
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
            "event_type": event_type,
            "data": data,
        }
        self.events.append(event)
```

**Key Features:**
- In-memory event storage with O(1) append operations
- JSON-serializable event structure for cross-system compatibility
- Backward compatibility with legacy visualization APIs
- Zero-dependency implementation for core stability

#### Pipeline Stage Management

The system defines standardized pipeline stages for workflow tracking:

```python
class PipelineStage:
    # Core workflow stages
    MCP_REQUEST = "mcp_request"
    AI_ANALYSIS = "ai_analysis"
    PRD_PARSING = "prd_parsing"
    TASK_GENERATION = "task_generation"
    TASK_CREATION = "task_creation"
    TASK_COMPLETION = "task_completion"
```

This standardization enables:
- Consistent event categorization across Marcus workflows
- Predictable event streams for external visualization tools
- Standardized performance metrics collection
- Workflow pattern analysis and optimization

#### Event-Driven Workflow Tracking (`pipeline_flow.py`)

Individual workflow instances are tracked through PipelineFlow objects:

```python
class PipelineFlow:
    def __init__(self, flow_id: str, flow_type: str = "general"):
        self.flow_id = flow_id
        self.flow_type = flow_type
        self.stages: List[PipelineStage] = []
        self.status = "created"
        self.created_at = datetime.now().isoformat()
        self.metadata = {}
```

**Technical Capabilities:**
- State machine-based workflow progression (created → running → completed/failed)
- Hierarchical stage composition with metadata preservation
- Immutable event history for audit trails
- Real-time status synchronization with external systems

#### Pipeline Flow Manager (`pipeline_manager.py`)

The PipelineFlowManager orchestrates multiple concurrent workflows:

```python
class PipelineFlowManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.flows: Dict[str, PipelineFlow] = {}
        self.visualizer = SharedPipelineVisualizer()

    def create_flow(self, flow_id: str, flow_type: str = "general") -> PipelineFlow:
        flow = PipelineFlow(flow_id, flow_type)
        self.flows[flow_id] = flow
        self.visualizer.start_flow(flow_id, {"flow_type": flow_type})
        return flow
```

**Advanced Features:**
- Concurrent flow management with thread-safe operations
- Automatic event propagation to visualization subsystems
- Flow lifecycle management (creation, execution, completion, cleanup)
- Resource-aware flow scheduling and prioritization

#### Conversation Integration (`conversation_adapter.py`)

The conversation adapter provides seamless integration with Marcus's agent event system:

```python
def log_agent_event(event_type: str, data: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Stub for logging agent events - delegates to conversation logger"""
    try:
        from src.logging.agent_events import log_agent_event as real_log_agent_event
        real_log_agent_event(event_type, data)
    except ImportError:
        # Graceful degradation when conversation logger unavailable
        pass
```

**Integration Strategy:**
- Lazy loading of conversation logging infrastructure
- Graceful degradation when logging subsystems are unavailable
- Event forwarding with preserved metadata and context
- Type-safe event routing based on event classification

#### Pipeline-Conversation Bridge (`pipeline_conversation_bridge.py`)

This component creates bidirectional communication between pipeline events and conversation logs:

```python
class PipelineConversationBridge:
    def log_pipeline_conversation(self, pipeline_id: str, stage: str,
                                 message: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None):
        entry = {
            "pipeline_id": pipeline_id,
            "stage": stage,
            "message": message,
            "metadata": metadata or {},
            "timestamp": None,  # Set by conversation logger
        }
        self.conversation_log.append(entry)
```

**Technical Innovations:**
- Bi-directional event correlation between pipelines and conversations
- Stage-specific conversation categorization
- Metadata preservation across system boundaries
- Temporal event ordering and synchronization

#### Replay System (`pipeline_replay.py`)

The replay controller enables historical workflow analysis:

```python
class PipelineReplayController:
    def start_replay(self, flow_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        session = {
            "flow_id": flow_id,
            "status": "active",
            "current_position": 0,
            "total_events": 0,
        }
        self.replay_sessions[flow_id] = session
        return session
```

**Replay Capabilities:**
- Event-by-event workflow reconstruction
- Bidirectional temporal navigation (forward/backward stepping)
- Position-based random access to workflow history
- Multi-session replay support for comparative analysis

## Integration with Marcus Ecosystem

def report_task_progress(agent_id: str, task_id: str, status: str,
                        progress: int = 0, message: str = ""):
    # Event logging occurs automatically
    log_agent_event("task_progress_update", {
        "agent_id": agent_id,
        "task_id": task_id,
        "status": status,
        "progress": progress
    })
```
