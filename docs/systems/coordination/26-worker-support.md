# Worker Support System

## Overview

The Worker Support system is Marcus's sophisticated infrastructure for enabling autonomous agent workers to communicate with the Marcus server through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This system provides the client-side foundation that allows AI agents to participate in the Marcus ecosystem by registering themselves, requesting tasks, reporting progress, and handling blockers in a fully autonomous manner.

### Key Classes

#### WorkerMCPClient
The primary client class that provides a high-level interface for worker agents to communicate with Marcus:

- **Connection Management**: Handles MCP connection lifecycle through stdio pipes
- **Tool Operations**: Provides methods for all Marcus operations (register, request tasks, report progress)
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error recovery and meaningful error messages
- **Session State**: Maintains connection state and ensures proper cleanup

#### Connection Architecture
```python
# Marcus server command discovery
server_cmd = [
    "python",
    os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "..", "marcus_mcp_server.py"),
]

# MCP stdio transport
async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read_stream, write_stream):
    async with ClientSession(read_stream, write_stream) as session:
        # Worker operations
```

## Marcus Ecosystem Integration

### Position in Architecture
The Worker Support system sits at the **client edge** of the Marcus ecosystem, serving as the bridge between:

1. **AI Agents** (Claude, GPT-4, custom workers) - External systems
2. **Marcus Server** - Core orchestration system
3. **Kanban Boards** - Task persistence layer (Planka, Linear, GitHub)
4. **AI Analysis Engine** - Intelligence and recommendations

### Data Flow
```
Agent → WorkerMCPClient → MCP Protocol → Marcus Server → Kanban/Memory/Context
  │                                                           │
  └─────────────── AI Suggestions & Context ←─────────────────┘
```

### Integration Points

- **Task Assignment Engine**: Receives AI-powered optimal task assignments
- **Context System**: Gets rich task context including dependencies and previous implementations
- **Memory System**: Benefits from predictions and learning-based recommendations
- **Event System**: Participates in event-driven architecture for real-time coordination
- **Visualization**: Activity feeds into pipeline visualization and monitoring

## Typical Workflow Invocation

The Worker Support system is invoked in this standard sequence:

### 1. Project Initialization
```
Human: create_project → Marcus Server → Kanban Board Creation
```

### 2. Agent Registration
```
Worker: register_agent → Marcus Server → Agent Registry Update
```

### 3. Task Request Loop
```
Worker: request_next_task → Marcus Server → AI-Powered Task Selection → Context Enrichment → Task Assignment
```

### 4. Progress Reporting
```
Worker: report_task_progress → Marcus Server → Kanban Update → Memory Recording → Event Publishing
```

### 5. Blocker Handling
```
Worker: report_blocker → Marcus Server → AI Analysis → Suggestion Generation → Kanban Documentation
```

### 6. Task Completion
```
Worker: report_task_progress(completed) → Marcus Server → Assignment Cleanup → Code Analysis → Memory Update
```

## What Makes This System Special

### 1. **Intelligent Task Matching**
- Uses AI analysis to match agent skills with task requirements
- Considers workload distribution and dependency readiness
- Factors in agent performance history and learning trajectories

### 2. **Rich Context Delivery**
- Provides implementation context from previous work (GitHub integration)
- Delivers dependency awareness for downstream impact
- Includes AI predictions for success probability and completion time

### 3. **Tiered Instruction Generation**
```python
def build_tiered_instructions(base_instructions, task, context_data, dependency_awareness, predictions):
    # Layer 1: Base instructions
    # Layer 2: Implementation context
    # Layer 3: Dependency awareness
    # Layer 4: Decision logging prompts
    # Layer 5: Predictions and warnings
    # Layer 6: Task-specific guidance
```

### 4. **Autonomous Error Resolution**
- AI-powered blocker analysis provides actionable suggestions
- Severity-based escalation ensures appropriate response
- Pattern recognition identifies recurring issues

### 5. **Performance Learning**
- Tracks agent performance over time
- Identifies improving skills and provides growth opportunities
- Adjusts task assignments based on success patterns

## Technical Implementation Details

### Connection Management
```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def connect_to_marcus(self) -> AsyncIterator[ClientSession]:
    # Dynamic server command construction
    # Stdio pipe establishment
    # Session initialization and verification
    # Automatic cleanup on exit
```

### Tool Call Interface
All worker operations use the same underlying pattern:
```python
result = await self.session.call_tool(
    "tool_name",
    arguments={
        "param1": value1,
        "param2": value2,
    },
)
return json.loads(result.content[0].text) if result.content else {}
```

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Connection Errors**: Clear error messages with retry guidance
- **Tool Errors**: Structured error responses with context
- **Empty Responses**: Graceful handling of missing data
- **Session State**: Runtime validation of connection status

### Response Serialization
The system handles complex data structures through Marcus's MCP utils:
```python
from src.marcus_mcp.utils import serialize_for_mcp
return serialize_for_mcp(response)  # Handles datetime, enums, etc.
```

## Simple vs Complex Task Handling

### Simple Task Scenario
```python
# Basic task assignment
task = {
    "id": "simple-001",
    "name": "Fix button styling",
    "instructions": "Update CSS for primary button"
}
# No context or predictions needed
```

### Complex Task Scenario
```python
# Rich task assignment
task = {
    "id": "complex-001",
    "name": "Implement user authentication",
    "instructions": "...",  # Multi-layer instructions
    "implementation_context": [...],  # Previous API patterns
    "dependency_awareness": "3 future tasks depend on your work",
    "predictions": {
        "success_probability": 0.75,
        "completion_time": {"expected_hours": 6.5},
        "blockage_analysis": {"overall_risk": 0.3}
    }
}
```

### Task Complexity Factors
- **Label-based guidance**: API, frontend, database, security tasks get specialized instructions
- **Dependency count**: High-impact tasks get decision logging prompts
- **Agent experience**: Instructions adapt to agent's skill trajectory
- **Project context**: GitHub integration provides implementation patterns

## Board-Specific Considerations

### Planka Integration
- Uses HTTP API for task updates
- Supports rich comments for blocker documentation
- Handles checklist-based progress tracking

### GitHub Integration
- Provides implementation context from repository analysis
- Code analysis on task completion
- Issue-based task management with PR linking

### Linear Integration
- API-based task synchronization
- Team-aware assignment logic
- Sprint and cycle integration

### Provider Abstraction
```python
# All providers implement common interface
self.kanban_client = KanbanFactory.create(self.provider)
await self.kanban_client.update_task(task_id, update_data)
```

## Integration with Seneca

While Seneca (the strategic AI layer) is not directly integrated with the Worker Support system, they interact through:

### Indirect Integration Points
1. **Task Generation**: Seneca's strategic analysis influences the tasks that workers receive
2. **Project Planning**: Seneca's project structure feeds into worker task assignments
3. **Resource Allocation**: Seneca's capacity planning affects worker load balancing
4. **Performance Analysis**: Worker metrics feed back to Seneca for strategic adjustments

### Future Integration Opportunities
- Direct Seneca consultation for complex task decisions
- Strategic context injection into worker instructions
- Resource reallocation based on Seneca recommendations

```

### Worker Support Role by Phase:

1. **create_project**: Not involved - Human uses Marcus directly
2. **register_agent**: **Primary** - Workers use this to join the system
3. **request_next_task**: **Primary** - Core worker operation for getting assignments
4. **report_progress**: **Primary** - Workers report milestone progress
5. **report_blocker**: **Primary** - Workers get AI help when stuck
6. **finish_task**: **Primary** - Workers report completion and trigger cleanup

The Worker Support system is **essential** for 5 of 6 workflow phases, making it the primary interface between autonomous agents and Marcus.
