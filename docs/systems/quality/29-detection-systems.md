# Detection Systems - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Detection Systems form a critical intelligence layer in Marcus that automatically analyzes kanban board state and user context to recommend the optimal operating mode. This system bridges the gap between raw board data and intelligent mode selection, enabling Marcus to adapt dynamically to different project scenarios without explicit configuration.

## System Architecture

The detection systems consist of two primary components working in tandem:

### 1. Board Analyzer (`src/detection/board_analyzer.py`)
- **Primary Function**: Analyzes kanban board characteristics to determine structure quality and recommend initial operating modes
- **Input**: List of tasks from a kanban board
- **Output**: `BoardState` object with comprehensive analysis metrics

### 2. Context Detector (`src/detection/context_detector.py`)
- **Primary Function**: Combines board analysis with user interaction patterns to make final mode recommendations
- **Input**: Board state, user messages, interaction history
- **Output**: `ModeRecommendation` with confidence scores and reasoning

## Integration in Marcus Ecosystem

### Position in Architecture
The Detection Systems sit at the **intelligence layer** of Marcus, specifically between:
- **Data Layer**: Raw kanban board data (tasks, labels, descriptions)
- **Decision Layer**: Mode selection and agent coordination
- **Execution Layer**: Actual task assignment and work coordination

### Dependencies
- **Core Models**: Uses `Task`, `TaskStatus`, `Priority` from `src.core.models`
- **Kanban Integration**: Receives board data via kanban providers
- **MCP Server**: Detection results influence MCP tool behavior

### Integration Points
1. **Project Creation**: Analyzes empty boards to recommend Creator mode
2. **Agent Registration**: Considers board state when agents request tasks
3. **Mode Switching**: Continuously monitors board evolution for mode recommendations
4. **User Interaction**: Parses user messages for explicit intent signals

## Workflow Integration

In the typical Marcus workflow scenario:

```
create_project → register_agent → request_next_task → report_progress → report_blocker → finish_task
                      ↑                    ↑                     ↑
                   Detection           Detection              Detection
                   (initial)         (continuous)          (evolution)
```

### Specific Invocation Points

1. **Project Creation**:
   - Triggered when `create_project` receives a new board ID
   - Analyzes board to determine if Creator mode should generate initial structure
   - Confidence: 95% for empty boards

2. **Agent Registration**:
   - Called during `register_agent` to understand board maturity
   - Influences which types of agents should be deployed
   - Helps determine agent skill requirements

3. **Task Request Cycles**:
   - Invoked before each `request_next_task` to ensure optimal mode
   - Adapts to board evolution as tasks are completed
   - Monitors for chaos/organization threshold crossings

4. **Progress Monitoring**:
   - Tracks how `report_progress` calls affect board structure
   - Detects when boards transition between organization levels
   - Adjusts recommendations based on completion patterns

## What Makes This System Special

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Analysis
Unlike simple rule-based systems, Marcus detection performs comprehensive analysis across:
- **Structural Metrics**: Task descriptions, labels, estimates, dependencies
- **Workflow Patterns**: Sequential vs parallel vs phased execution
- **Component Detection**: Frontend, backend, database, infrastructure components
- **Phase Recognition**: Setup, design, development, testing, deployment phases

### 2. Confidence-Based Recommendations
Every recommendation includes:
- **Confidence Score**: 0.0-1.0 based on signal strength
- **Reasoning**: Human-readable explanation of decision factors
- **Alternatives**: Ranked alternative modes with reasoning

### 3. Context-Aware Intelligence
The system maintains user context including:
- **Message History**: Recent interaction patterns
- **Mode Preferences**: Historical usage patterns by user
- **Intent Detection**: Real-time parsing of user goals

### 4. Dynamic Adaptation
Board recommendations evolve as projects mature:
- **Empty Board** → Creator mode (95% confidence)
- **Chaotic Board** → Enricher mode (85% confidence)
- **Well-Structured** → Adaptive mode (90% confidence)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Board Analysis Algorithm

```python
async def calculate_structure_score(self, tasks: List[Task]) -> float:
    """
    Weighted scoring across multiple dimensions:
    - Descriptions (25%): Quality and length of task descriptions
    - Labels (20%): Presence of categorization labels
    - Estimates (25%): Time/complexity estimates
    - Priority Distribution (15%): Balanced priority assignment
    - Dependencies (15%): Task relationship definition
    """
```

**Scoring Thresholds**:
- `0.0-0.3`: Chaotic (task titles only)
- `0.3-0.6`: Basic organization
- `0.6-0.8`: Good structure
- `0.8-1.0`: Excellent metadata

### Workflow Pattern Detection

The system recognizes four primary workflow patterns:

1. **Sequential**: One task in progress, orderly completion
2. **Parallel**: Multiple concurrent tasks (3+ in progress)
3. **Phased**: Clear development phases detected in task names
4. **Ad Hoc**: No discernible pattern

**Detection Logic**:
```python
if in_progress == 1 and total > 5:
    return WorkflowPattern.SEQUENTIAL
elif in_progress > 3:
    return WorkflowPattern.PARALLEL
elif len(phases) >= 3:
    return WorkflowPattern.PHASED
```

### Intent Recognition System

Uses regex pattern matching across user messages:

```python
INTENT_PATTERNS = {
    UserIntent.CREATE: [
        r"create.*project", r"new.*project", r"start.*from.*scratch",
        r"generate.*tasks", r"from.*prd", r"build.*mvp"
    ],
    UserIntent.ORGANIZE: [
        r"organize", r"structure", r"clean.*up", r"add.*metadata"
    ],
    UserIntent.COORDINATE: [
        r"assign", r"next.*task", r"who.*should", r"coordinate"
    ]
}
```

### Component and Phase Detection

**Component Patterns**:
- Frontend: `(frontend|ui|client|react|vue|angular)`
- Backend: `(backend|api|server|endpoint|service)`
- Database: `(database|db|sql|mongo|redis|cache)`
- Infrastructure: `(infra|devops|ci|cd|docker|k8s)`

**Phase Patterns**:
- Setup: `(setup|init|initialize|config|configure|scaffold)`
- Design: `(design|architect|plan|model|schema)`
- Development: `(implement|build|create|develop|code)`
- Testing: `(test|qa|quality|verify|validate)`
- Deployment: `(deploy|release|launch|ship|production)`

## Simple vs Complex Task Handling

### Simple Tasks (< 5 tasks, low structure)
- **Recommendation**: Creator mode
- **Confidence**: High (0.90+)
- **Reasoning**: Limited scope suggests need for structure generation
- **Fallback**: Enricher mode if creation fails

### Complex Tasks (10+ tasks, varied structure)
- **Analysis**: Multi-dimensional scoring across all metrics
- **Recommendation**: Based on structure score and workflow patterns
- **Confidence**: Moderate (0.70-0.85)
- **Adaptability**: Continuous monitoring for threshold crossings

### Chaos Detection
Special handling for "chaotic" boards:
- **Threshold**: Structure score < 0.3 with 10+ tasks
- **Mode**: Enricher (immediate organization needed)
- **Priority**: High confidence (0.85) due to clear need

## Board-Specific Considerations

### Empty Boards
- **Immediate Response**: Creator mode recommendation
- **User Guidance**: "Describe your project and I'll help create tasks"
- **Alternative**: Manual task creation with Enricher support

### Legacy Boards
- **Assessment**: Structure score calculation across existing tasks
- **Migration Path**: Enricher mode to add missing metadata
- **Preservation**: Maintain existing organization patterns

### Multi-Component Projects
- **Detection**: Component pattern recognition across tasks
- **Coordination**: Adaptive mode for cross-component dependencies
- **Specialization**: Component-specific agent deployment

### Agile Boards
- **Pattern Recognition**: Sprint/iteration detection
- **Mode Selection**: Adaptive mode for established processes
- **Enhancement**: Enricher mode for metadata gaps
