# Marcus Logging System: Technical Documentation

## Overview

The Marcus logging system is a comprehensive, structured logging infrastructure designed to capture all conversations, decisions, and interactions between Workers, Marcus (PM), and the Kanban Board components. It consists of two primary modules that work in tandem to provide both detailed conversation tracking and lightweight event logging.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ConversationLogger** (`src/logging/conversation_logger.py`)
   - Full-featured structured logging system
   - JSON-based log storage with automatic rotation
   - Hierarchical conversation categorization
   - Rich metadata capture and analysis capabilities

2. **Agent Events Logger** (`src/logging/agent_events.py`)
   - Lightweight event logging without dependencies
   - Fast, safe logging for core Marcus operations
   - Simple JSON Lines format for event storage
   - Designed for visualization pipeline integration

### Conversation Types

The system categorizes all interactions into distinct conversation types:

```python
class ConversationType(Enum):
    WORKER_TO_PM = "worker_to_pm"        # Worker → Marcus communications
    PM_TO_WORKER = "pm_to_worker"        # Marcus → Worker communications
    PM_TO_KANBAN = "pm_to_kanban"        # Marcus → Kanban interactions
    KANBAN_TO_PM = "kanban_to_pm"        # Kanban → Marcus notifications
    INTERNAL_THINKING = "internal_thinking"  # Internal reasoning processes
    DECISION = "decision"                 # Formal decisions with rationale
    ERROR = "error"                       # Error conditions and failures
```

## Integration with Marcus Ecosystem

### 1. Agent Registration Flow
When an agent registers via `register_agent`:
```python
# Step 1: Log incoming request
conversation_logger.log_worker_message(agent_id, "to_pm", message, metadata)

# Step 2: Log Marcus thinking process
log_thinking("marcus", thought, context)

# Step 3: Log decision with confidence
conversation_logger.log_pm_decision(decision, rationale, confidence_score)

# Step 4: Log event for visualization
log_agent_event("worker_registration", event_data)

# Step 5: Log response
conversation_logger.log_worker_message(agent_id, "from_pm", response)
```

### 2. Task Assignment Flow
When an agent requests a task via `request_next_task`:
```python
# Log request
conversation_logger.log_worker_message(agent_id, "to_pm", "Requesting task")

# Log thinking about state
log_thinking("marcus", "Need to check current project state")

# Log task analysis
log_thinking("marcus", f"Finding optimal task for {agent.name}", context)

# Log assignment decision
conversation_logger.log_task_assignment(task_id, worker_id, details, score)

# Log kanban interaction
conversation_logger.log_kanban_interaction("move_task", "to_kanban", data)
```

### 3. Progress Reporting Flow
When workers report progress via `report_task_progress`:
```python
# Log progress update
conversation_logger.log_progress_update(
    worker_id, task_id, progress, status, message, metrics
)

# Log kanban synchronization
conversation_logger.log_kanban_interaction("update_task", "to_kanban", data)

# Log system state snapshot
conversation_logger.log_system_state(
    active_workers, tasks_in_progress, tasks_completed, tasks_blocked, metrics
)
```

### 4. Blocker Reporting Flow
When workers encounter blockers via `report_blocker`:
```python
# Log blocker with severity
conversation_logger.log_blocker(
    worker_id, task_id, description, severity,
    suggested_solutions, resolution_attempts
)

# Log Marcus analysis
log_thinking("marcus", "Analyzing blocker impact", context)

# Log resolution decision
conversation_logger.log_pm_decision(resolution, rationale, alternatives)
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Structured Logging Configuration
The ConversationLogger uses `structlog` with comprehensive processors:

```python
structlog.configure(
    processors=[
        structlog.stdlib.filter_by_level,
        structlog.stdlib.add_logger_name,
        structlog.stdlib.add_log_level,
        structlog.stdlib.PositionalArgumentsFormatter(),
        structlog.processors.TimeStamper(fmt="iso"),
        structlog.processors.StackInfoRenderer(),
        structlog.processors.format_exc_info,
        structlog.processors.UnicodeDecoder(),
        structlog.processors.JSONRenderer(),
    ],
    context_class=dict,
    logger_factory=structlog.stdlib.LoggerFactory(),
    cache_logger_on_first_use=True,
)
```

### 2. File Organization
- **Conversation logs**: `logs/conversations/conversations_{timestamp}.jsonl`
- **Decision logs**: `logs/conversations/decisions_{timestamp}.jsonl`
- **Agent events**: `logs/agent_events/agent_events_{date}.jsonl`

### 3. Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Internal thinking, reasoning processes
- **INFO**: Normal operations, task assignments, progress
- **WARNING**: Blockers, degraded performance
- **ERROR**: System failures, critical issues

### 4. Metadata Capture
Each log entry includes comprehensive metadata:
- Timestamps (ISO format)
- Participant identifiers
- Conversation types
- Structured context data
- Performance metrics
- Decision factors and confidence scores

## Special Features

    decision="Assign critical task to worker_senior_1",
    rationale="Worker has security expertise and availability",
    alternatives_considered=[{
        "option": "Assign to junior",
        "score": 0.4,
        "reason_rejected": "Task criticality requires experience"
    }],
    confidence_score=0.85,
    decision_factors={
        "skill_match": 0.95,
        "availability": 0.80,
        "task_criticality": "high"
    }

4. **Feedback Loops**: Logged outcomes enable Seneca to refine predictions

## Typical Scenario Flow

Here's how logging works through a complete task lifecycle:

1. **create_project** → Logs project initialization, configuration decisions
2. **register_agent** → Logs agent capabilities, role assignment rationale
3. **request_next_task** → Logs task analysis, skill matching, assignment decision
4. **report_progress** → Logs completion percentage, performance metrics, status changes
5. **report_blocker** → Logs blocker details, severity assessment, resolution attempts
6. **finish_task** → Logs completion metrics, quality assessment, lessons learned

Each step generates multiple log entries across different categories, creating a complete audit trail of the project execution.
